<html><body><h2>New tool for your toolbox</h2><br>July 13th, 2010<br><br>



				<p>Actually, the title of this blog is a bit misleading.  It should read &#8220;a new toolbox for your toolbox collection&#8221; <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever done a web app pen test, you know that it gets messy really quick.  Add in source code auditing, screen shots, movie shots, reporting, etc. etc. and you end up with tons and tons of tools running, large folders of data, and a headache when it comes time to put all this data into a presentable format.</p>
<p>Dinis Cruz is hoping to relieve some of this headache with his new OWASP O2 platform.  This single interface ties together source code auditing, some penetration testing tools, integration with 3rd party scanners (in the future), windows productivity tools, movie editor, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>I installed it and have been playing with it.  As with any toolbox, there will always be things you would like to see, but this beta release (1.2) has a ton of features and hooks for many more.</p>
<p>So, go and try it!  You can get the code from <a href="http://www.o2platform.com/wiki/O2_Release/v1.1_Beta">http://www.o2platform.com/wiki/O2_Release/v1.1_Beta</a></p>
