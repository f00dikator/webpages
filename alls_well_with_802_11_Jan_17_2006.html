                                <p>So, 802.11 is maturing.  Big companies which have avoided being early adopters may be getting ready to roll out their 802.11  networks or RFID.   You might want to hold on just a sec.</p><br><br>
<p>There&#8217;s a mini-thread on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071006034840/http://www.immunitysec.com/mailman/listinfo/dailydave">DD</a> about wireless insecurities.  That&#8217;s cool.  However, in my humble opinion, the major flaw with wireless devices is that they are forced into the position of being a network edge device without any hardening whatsoever.  Putting an 802.11 card (driver) or an AP at the edge of a network is like putting the Coast Guard on the front lines of an infantry battle.  It just doesn&#8217;t fit.</p>
<p>Security researchers seem to be interested in drilling little holes around the larger holes drilled so many years ago.  That&#8217;s typical.  However, I don&#8217;t expect it&#8217;ll be too long before all the encryption weaknesses, hijacks, replay attacks, etc. get played out and folks go after the INHERENT weakness with 802.11.  Where do most 802.11 drivers process layer 2 traffic?  Think about that.  Voltaire said it best:</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8230;And as with quaking voice<br/>
mortal and pitiful ye cry, &#8220;All&#8217;s well.&#8221;<br/>
The universe belies you, and your heart<br/>
refutes a hundred times your mind&#8217;s conceit&#8217;<br/>
&#8211;Voltaire
