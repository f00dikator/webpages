<html><body><h2>Another hack-a-hack attack</h2><br>May 29th, 2008<br><br>


				<p>So, I blogged about this topic a while back.  This week I&#8217;ve been playing with keyloggers.  I had my keyloggers setup on win2k3 and winxp machines and I was accessing them via RDP.  I made the mistake of keeping my RDP session nailed up.  A few days later, I note tons of entries being displayed within the keylogger GUI.  Of course, since the clipboard auto-synchs between the client machine and the RDP server, the keylogger on the virtual machine had been logging the clipboard contents from my home machine.  I had been doing tons of code edits, so every cut-and-paste was captured and displayed by the keylogger software.  Pretty embarrassing!</p>
<p>Now, what would I find if I setup a machine on a stub network, installed a keyboard logger, and let the hackers come on in?  For everyone attaching to my machine, I would be snagging their clipboard.  That might be interesting data.</p>
