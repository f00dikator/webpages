<html><body><h2>Errata</h2><br>April 25th, 2007<br><br>


				<p>Just a few quick snippets.</p>
<p>First, as mentioned on <a href="http://blog.vulnerableminds.com">vulnerableminds.com</a>, Google has some kick-ass training videos available.  I recommend the following search: <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=type%3Agoogle+engEDU+security">http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=type%3Agoogle+engEDU+security</a></p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;m still trying to break my Motorola Q.  However, the fuzzing is going slow due to a stupid little thing called DHCP!  I have to literally watch the fuzzing as my IP changes so often.  Add to this the fact that I&#8217;m naturally lazy and prone to distraction and you have a recipe for disaster (read: lawsuit).  An interesting post on cell phone (in)security can be found <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/print/expert/article/millionaire/30108">here</a>.</p>
<p>Third, I&#8217;m into source code scanning (well, actually, I&#8217;m into the automation of source code scanning).  I&#8217;ve mentioned Ounce labs in the past&#8230;Well, <a href="http://blogs.owasp.org/diniscruz/">Dinis Cruz</a> was just cajoled into doing some work for them.  I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with Dinis in the past.  This freaking guy is a .NET ninja!  I expect Ounce will be kicking butt in this arena very soon.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, if you&#8217;re a GPF fan there is a very cool movie that Jared Demott put together.  Go see it <a href="http://www.appliedsec.com/files/gpf_demo/gpf_demo.html">here</a></p>
