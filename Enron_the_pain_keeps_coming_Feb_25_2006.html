<html><body><h2>Enron - The Pain Keeps coming</h2><br>Feb 25th, 2006<br><br>

Note: I posted this to slashdot along with proof of the Private data. It has not yet been approved.<br><br>

A year (or more) ago, a large batch of Enron emails were released to the public. This data set has been very useful from a ‘Research’ perspective. Just this weekend, I was using it to test the speed of PCRE vs Python vs Perl…until I happened upon a little nugget of information which led me to look at the dataset from a Security/Privacy perspective.
<br><br>
It appears as if data is included within these emails which violates individual Privacy. The data includes, but is not limited to, Account information to non-Enron applications (FTP login credentials, web credentials, etc.), Parent-teacher school data, private residence addresses, private residence phone numbers, Names and Social Security Numbers, and more.
<br><br>
Where did the Enron emails come from? The United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. That’s sad.
<br><br>
Some examples (I stripped out the SSN or Credit Card number with X’s, and changed the name/address):
