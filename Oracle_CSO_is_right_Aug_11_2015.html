<html><body><h2>Oracle CSO is right</h2><br>August 11th, 2015<br><br>


	<p>The internet (or at least twitter) is exploding regarding this, now deleted, post : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150811052336/https://blogs.oracle.com/maryanndavidson/entry/no_you_really_can_t">Mary Ann Davidson blog post</a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that she is right. Yes, she&#8217;s right. Breaking the EULA is against the law.  You can&#8217;t argue about that. </p>
<p>You can&#8217;t argue that they should be paying a bug bounty. You may *want* them to pay a bug bounty, but that is the companies decision. If they choose not to pay a bug bounty, that&#8217;s their prerogative.    </p>
<p>As a consumer, you can choose to use their product (EULA and all) or not. That is something that you have control over.  </p>
<p>As a researcher, you can choose to break the EULA or not. Arguing that someone should modify their EULA so that what you&#8217;re doing isn&#8217;t a violation is childish. </p>
<p>I wish Oracle had stood by their CSO and left the blog online. I understand that they don&#8217;t want additional scrutiny on their product, but the scrutiny will be there irregardless (as it has been for many years now). Leaving the post online would have shown some &#8216;backbone&#8217;. If INFOSEC goes PC, it&#8217;s bad for us all. I&#8217;d rather someone tell me what they really think and we can go from there.  </p>
