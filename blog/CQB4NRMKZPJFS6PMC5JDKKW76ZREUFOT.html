				<p>After being <a href="http://www.whitestar.linuxbox.org/pipermail/fuzzing/2007-March/000337.html">challenged by Gadi</a>, we decided to make the beSTORM .ANI file fuzzing module description available publicly.</p>
<p>This module is interesting because Microsoft&#8217;s fuzzing team, using a template-based fuzzing module, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sdl/archive/2007/04/26/lessons-learned-from-the-animated-cursor-security-bug.aspx">missed</a> during their testing a vulnerability that turned out to be a <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/5XP0515L5W.html">zero-day</a>. We built it by simply feeding a few sample files into <a href="http://www.beyondsecurity.com/beSTORM">beSTORM</a> and using its autolearn feature to produce a file fuzzing module. The module we produced does catch the 0-day but we welcome any feedback as to how good or bad this module actually is.</p>
<p>The fuzzing module description is available <a href="http://www.beyondsecurity.com/bestorm_animodule.html">here</a>.

				<p>I figured it is high time for an off-topic post, and it was so off-topic I ended up just moving it to <a href="http://gevron.livejournal.com/">my &#8220;fun blog&#8221;</a> which I haven&#8217;t updated in over a year.</p>
<p>Here it is just for kicks:</p>
<p>A friend recently wrote to the SF-hackers mailing list that she loved Spiderman III. I couldn&#8217;t resist writing how much I disagree with her. (<a href="http://whitestar.linuxbox.org/mailman/listinfo/sf-hackers">SF-hackers</a> is a mailing list for hackers, security dorks, old NANOG and IETF folks, etc. who love science fiction, anime, comics, etc.).</p>
<p>Honestly? I&#8217;d suggest to people to skip it. I love Spiderman. His sarcasm rulez!!!111!!11111111</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t like the movie.</p>
<p>Reasons vary from too much B/S (rambling, crying, crying, rambling, more crying) to comic abuse (as a friend said &#8220;did they really put these two girls together in one film? Might as well have brought in Lois Lane&#8221;).<br />
Did I mention the crying yet?</p>
<p>They were very comic-faithful in other occasions, though, such as the Church bell scene, and there were many scenes only devoted fans probably understood (mostly with old men in them).</p>
<p>Also, what&#8217;s with having 3 bad guys in one movie?!</p>
<p>As to the friendly neighborhood Spiderman jumping on flags, I found it quite cool considering it&#8217;s Spiderman III. Everything after it made me realize just how disgusting Hollywood movies are these days with politics everywhere (even 300 - spit - had a &#8220;for freedom!!&#8221; element).<br />
The movie could only be more ideological if it mentioned Iraq. As a good friend said: &#8220;that&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t make a Captain America movie!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had fun, but as I read in some SF forum: &#8220;you laughed when you were supposed to cry, and cried when you were supposed to laugh&#8221;. Another comment there was &#8220;I came ready for Auntie May&#8217;s lecture, but this movie was really just too much!&#8221;</p>
<p>All the foreplay, no game. In the same forum I mention above someone suggested just watching the action scenes would be great (about 10 minutes out of the very long movie). I got reminded of a British late-evening (get back from the pub) show not many brits have actually watched - Coupling. Amazing show. Cult for me.</p>
<p>In Coupling, Jeff often watches movies in a very similar fashion (not exact quote):<br />
&#8220;Yeah, the nudity in that movie was amazing!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Jeff, it was just one scene!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Depends how you watch it!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather watch a Coupling re-run, than Spiderman III.</p>
<p>[Important note: not the failed US version of Coupling]</p>
<p>Yes, as bad as it was I did have fun. I contradict myself? That&#8217;s nothing new. I love supporting different view-points, even (or especially) if they are mine. <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
On that note, at defcon 14 (2006) someone spoke with me on how I liked defcon after a prolonged discussion between goons in the speaker room on what they thought, I said &#8220;I&#8217;m having fun&#8221; or something in that playground. Paul Vixie was not convinced and chimed in: &#8220;Don&#8217;t take Gadi&#8217;s viewpoint on these things, his country is currently in war being bombed, and people die over there.&#8221;. I am not sure if he was suggesting I am not in touch with reality or being overly optimistic, but I tend to believe both of these have some merit.<br />
As usual, not an exact quote.</p>
<p>Gadi Evron.

<p>I think that security community is interested of the state of these more recent April bugs too.</p>
<p>Information here:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We disclsed 19 bugs this month, about 14 of which were fixed within a day or two of publication, which demonstrates two interesting facts: the Myspace web design and security groups can fix bugs if they care to, and b) the Myspace web design and security groups tend to fix bugs if they&#8217;re presented in an easy to read and high profile &#8220;Month of&#8221; format.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is what the site is reporting at their main page:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> Cryptome is now on a new ISP, Network Solutions, another US giant like Verio,<br />
closely linked to the authorities. We&#8217;ll see if it can take the heat or cave.<br />

the censors: if one buckles we&#8217;ll sign up with another.</em></p></blockquote>

				<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I got out to the trade seminars.  You know, marketing&#8217;s traveling bumpf show, where they trot out the VP of sales, plus a &#8220;security evangelist&#8221; or somebody with some such title (who has a technical background, but likes schmoozing more than doing actual research).  I used to go to lots: it&#8217;s a good way to get up to speed when you first enter a field, but the law of diminishing returns tends to set in real fast in terms of actual information.</p>
<p>There were actually two that I signed up for this week.  SANS had one, and I&#8217;ve never been to any SANS stuff, so I went to that.  Intel also had a real dog and pony show, with extra associated vendors.  When I get home from these things, Gloria always asks me whether I&#8217;m glad I went.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I went to the SANS show.  Didn&#8217;t get much out of the presentation itself.  But the style of the presentation was intriguing: an awful lot of &#8220;cute stuff&#8221; demonstrated, without much actual information being relayed.  The attitude of the presenters was also interesting: they were definitely in it for the cash.<br />

				<p>In a post by Brian Krebs in the <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/04/virus_writers_taint_google_ad.html">Washington post</a>, Brian describes how Virus (malware) makers have started to spend cash on buying sponsored links of high-profile keywords which get regularly visited by poorly patched people so that they can infect them with malwares.</p>
<p>One such high-profile keyword is the <strong>BBB</strong>, the Better Business Bureau, which as you would guess it most average joes would go to visit and will look for, while buying something like <strong>Slashdot </strong>won&#8217;t <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>This of course is an interesting move, though not so much unexpected. I can see an &#8220;legit-company&#8221; coming soon, where a company of such malware distribution will have an R&#038;D - create new malwares and find new vulnerabilities, Marketing - buy high profile keywords, or generally get people interested in your malware infected web site and Sales - sell bot nets and infected/hacked computers for money type of organizations.

				<p>Just a few quick snippets.</p>
<p>First, as mentioned on <a href="http://blog.vulnerableminds.com">vulnerableminds.com</a>, Google has some kick-ass training videos available.  I recommend the following search: <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=type%3Agoogle+engEDU+security">http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=type%3Agoogle+engEDU+security</a></p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;m still trying to break my Motorola Q.  However, the fuzzing is going slow due to a stupid little thing called DHCP!  I have to literally watch the fuzzing as my IP changes so often.  Add to this the fact that I&#8217;m naturally lazy and prone to distraction and you have a recipe for disaster (read: lawsuit).  An interesting post on cell phone (in)security can be found <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/print/expert/article/millionaire/30108">here</a>.</p>
<p>Third, I&#8217;m into source code scanning (well, actually, I&#8217;m into the automation of source code scanning).  I&#8217;ve mentioned Ounce labs in the past&#8230;Well, <a href="http://blogs.owasp.org/diniscruz/">Dinis Cruz</a> was just cajoled into doing some work for them.  I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with Dinis in the past.  This freaking guy is a .NET ninja!  I expect Ounce will be kicking butt in this arena very soon.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, if you&#8217;re a GPF fan there is a very cool movie that Jared Demott put together.  Go see it <a href="http://www.appliedsec.com/files/gpf_demo/gpf_demo.html">here</a></p>

				<p>Being knee deep in online mischief all day I sometimes forget that most of the online attacks are simply extensions of offline ones. The Nigerian scam has been performed via fax and (snail) mail for decades now - I even got a 419 scam by postcard a year back that made me feel very special that someone will waste a stamp on me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Spam is obviously just an online extension of junk mail, only in a different order of magnitude, and same goes for phishing compared to identity theft. But there is one fraud scheme I&#8217;m especially fond of - <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/838">&#8216;pump-n-dump&#8217;</a>, where you get a spam email about a stock that&#8217;s about to go up (&#8221;skyrocket&#8221;), hoping enough people will buy it and make it go up so that the person who initiated the attack can sell quantities of this penny stock and leave the victims with a worthless piece of paper.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The &#8216;pump-n-dump&#8217; is an extension of phone-based fraud that was featured in the Sopranos (with Chris&#8217;s crew running the scam) and outlined nicely in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0181984/">&#8220;Boiler Room&#8221;</a>. Wikipedia has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler_room_%28business%29">nice description</a> on the scheme and origin of the term.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason I&#8217;m reminded of this is because I actually got a call from a boiler room, sorry, from a law office with offices in Park Avenue and London. The call could have been a scripted audition to &#8220;Boiler Room 2&#8243; to play the part of the junior associate creating warm leads to Ben Affleck&#8217;s gang. It included everything to the immortal &#8220;I will only call you if we have something really good&#8221; and &#8220;we might have something for you in 2 weeks&#8221;. Amazingly enough they did have something really good for me and exactly two weeks later I got a call from the Vin-Diesel wannabe following up on the warm lead created by the associate. Unfortunately this time I didn&#8217;t have the time to play along so I don&#8217;t know if he would have told me there&#8217;s a maximum for new clients and 5,000 shares is as much as he can sell me&#8230;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">My only complaint now is that my spam filter who is doing such a good job filtering pump-n-dumps is unable to handle human conversations and filter boiler room calls. Actually, there&#8217;s one more complaint - why is it I always get stuck in the Boiler Room-like movies instead of getting a visit from Halle Berry a-la swordfish?&#8230;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">

				<p>On 15th April Japanese Matousec Transparent Security group <a href="http://www.matousec.com/info/advisories/ZoneAlarm-Multiple-insufficient-argument-validation-of-hooked-SSDT-functions.php">reported</a> about several Insufficient Argument Validation vulnerabilities in Check Point Zone Labs ZoneAlarm. The problem was related to Vsdatant.sys driver.</p>
<p>ZoneAlarm Pro versions 6.5.737.000 and 6.1.744.001 have been reported as affected. The group said 7.0.302.000 includes a fix, but the latest version is 7.0.337. It appears that Matousec.com has a disclosure policy keeping issues three months confidential.</p>
<p>According to the advisory &#8220;probably all versions of ZoneAlarm products branches 6.x&#8221; include this flaw.</p>
<p>Today, in turn, a <span class="smlcontent">Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability <a href="http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=517">was reported</a> in </span><span class="smlcontent">Check Point Zone Labs SRESCAN IOCTL by iDefense.</span></p>
<p>iDefense advisory states that version 5.0.63.0 of Srescan.sys as installed with Zone Alarm Free is affected.</p>
<p>iDefense Labs informed <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/">Zone Labs</a> on 19th Dec &#8216;06 and again on 21th March &#8216;07. The vulnerability mentioned was reported to iDefense (VCP) by <strong>Ruben Santamarta</strong> of <a href="http://reversemode.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&#038;Itemid=1">reversemode.com</a>.
