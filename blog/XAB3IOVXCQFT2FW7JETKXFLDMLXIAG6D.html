				<p>I recently added a contact to my BlackBerry PIN network. The contact was informed of this via an email, and then went on to reply (accept) to this email based invitation.</p>
<p>The response sent from his blackberry was not visible in his &#8220;sent&#8221; folder, nor was it visible in my &#8220;inbox&#8221; as apparently BlackBerry has the ability to secretly delete emails as soon as they are processed - thus making it do things a bit &#8220;under the radar&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear to me how difficult it is to do this manually - adding of a contact to your BlackBerry PIN list - but here are some clues on the email mechanism. Apparently, you need to include in the subject and in the beginning of the message body (subject works in most cases - html appears to behave differently) the following string:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> < $RemoveOnDelivery,SuppressSaveInSentItems></em></p></blockquote>
<p>You can combine the above in the subject line with <em>confirm</em>, which will cause BlackBerry to send back a delivery confirmation, combined with the deletion and suppression of saving the item:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> < $confirm, RemoveOnDelivery,SuppressSaveInSentItems></em></p></blockquote>

				<p>Here&#8217;s something we knew ever since we implemented DLL Fuzzing in beSTORM: when you give direct API access you are likely to expose some serious weaknesses.</p>
<p>Those weaknesses can lead to Paris Hilton being exposed, if you know what I mean. Actually, I mean that literally: a myspace API given to Yahoo! <a href="http://valleywag.com/5012543/paris-hilton-lindsay-lohan-private-pics-exposed-by-yahoo-hack"title="Well, not _that_ kind of exposed" >exposes the private profiles</a> of Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. Some people will consider that a better find than overwriting the EIP.<br />
Here&#8217;s the howto, courtesy of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Byron_Ng/721828225"title="A link to his facebook page, what else?..." >Byron Ng</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. you&#8217;ll need a Yahoo account. go to www.yahoomail.com and create a yahoo account if you don&#8217;t have one already. and you will need to go to www.myspace.com to sign up for a myspace account first, if you don&#8217;t have one already.</p>
<p>2.go to http://beta.m.yahoo.com/w/gallery/widget click on the &#8216;mail&#8217; button under &#8220;sign in to yahoo!&#8221;</p>
<p>3. click on &#8216;click here to sign in&#8217;</p>
<p>4. enter your yahoo id, yahoo password</p>
<p>5. then on the top of the screen in the white box, enter: myspace then click Search Widgets Gallery</p>
<p>6. you will see a green box in the middle with the word &#8216;myspace&#8217; in there.</p>
<p>7. click the green myspace.</p>
<p>8. see in the middle of the screen it says &#8220;add it&#8221; - click that.</p>
<p>9. click yes when it asks you about sharing info</p>
<p>10. go here http://beta.m.yahoo.com/w/gallery/widget</p>
<p>11. enter myspace into the box. click search widgets gallery</p>
<p>12. click on the green myspace. now, since you have already set it up in the previous steps, it won&#8217;t ask you to download again</p>
<p>13. click on &#8216;go to widget&#8217; (that’s right below the &#8216;already added it&#8221; text</p>
<p>14. now sign in to myspace</p>
<p>15. now take the URL I asked you to save above before step 1: http://beta.m.yahoo.com/w/myspace/profile/en.osl?userID=16527727 and click on it. it may ask you to sign into yahoo or my space. sign in as appropriate. now you should be able to see the person&#8217;s pictures. if you can only see your own profile, then click on it again http://beta.m.yahoo.com/w/myspace/profile/en.osl?userID=16527727 then it will work.</p></blockquote>
<p>The moral of the story: Check you API, and check it well. If you don&#8217;t, others will&#8230;

				<p>We recently did some work finding inherited vulnerabilities in SNMP supporting devices - mainly embedded/hardware.</p>
<p>SNMP like many other protocols is defined in several RFCs, starting with the basic RFC that describes the protocol structure and goes up to RFC 3414 which describes how authentication and encryption (referred to as privacy by the SNMP spec) are done.</p>
<p>The RFC describes a few algorithms, such as the one for key localization, in great detail - i.e. providing a C source code:</p>
<p><code><strong><br />
void password_to_key_md5(<br />
u_char *password,    /* IN */<br />
u_int   passwordlen, /* IN */<br />
u_char *engineID,    /* IN  - pointer to snmpEngineID  */<br />
u_int   engineLength,/* IN  - length of snmpEngineID */<br />
u_char *key)         /* OUT - pointer to caller 16-octet buffer */<br />
{<br />
MD5_CTX     MD;<br />
u_char     *cp, password_buf[64];<br />
u_long      password_index = 0;<br />
u_long      count = 0, i;</p>
<p>MD5Init (&#038;MD);   /* initialize MD5 */</p>
<p>/**********************************************/<br />
/* Use while loop until we&#8217;ve done 1 Megabyte */<br />
/**********************************************/<br />
while (count < 1048576) {<br />
cp = password_buf;<br />
for (i = 0; i < 64; i++) {<br />
/*************************************************/<br />
/* Take the next octet of the password, wrapping */<br />
/* to the beginning of the password as necessary.*/<br />
/*************************************************/<br />
*cp++ = password[password_index++ % passwordlen];<br />
}<br />
MD5Update (&#038;MD, password_buf, 64);<br />
count += 64;<br />
}<br />
MD5Final (key, &#038;MD);          /* tell MD5 we're done */</p>
<p>/*****************************************************/<br />
/* Now localize the key with the engineID and pass   */<br />
/* through MD5 to produce final key                  */<br />
/* May want to ensure that engineLength <= 32,       */<br />
/* otherwise need to use a buffer larger than 64     */<br />
/*****************************************************/<br />
memcpy(password_buf, key, 16);<br />
memcpy(password_buf+16, engineID, engineLength);<br />
memcpy(password_buf+16+engineLength, key, 16);</p>
<p>MD5Init(&#038;MD);<br />
MD5Update(&#038;MD, password_buf, 32+engineLength);<br />
MD5Final(key, &#038;MD);<br />
return;<br />
}</strong><br />
</strong></code></p>
<p>People reading this RFC would jump with joy and just copy paste the above code into their own code and continue on their work of getting SNMP to work on their hardware.</p>
<p>Little will they know that the RFC team has made notice that:</p>
<blockquote><p>May want to ensure that engineLength < = 32, otherwise need to use a buffer larger than 64</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Ohh pff, who needs to ensure anything on my robust hardware - what is the worst that can happen, a server crash <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the worst that can happen is a neat buffer overflow, as no one guarantees that the engineID is limited to 32 bytes, in reality the length is not limited by the transport layer (the ASN.1) but rather only by the RFC specification, which again not everyone checks or conforms to it by 100%.</p>
<p>I would expect the RFC editors/creators to place sample code that is secure. Something like so would have sufficed to prevent the code from being easily exploited:<br />
<code><strong>memcpy(password_buf, key, 16);<br />
memcpy(password_buf+16, engineID, engineLength < 32 ? engineLength : 32);<br />
memcpy(password_buf+16+(engineLength < 32 ? engineLength : 32), key, 16);</strong></strong></code><br />
Especially since Google searching the above example proved that quite a few people were too lazy to not only fix the security issue but too lazy to remove the embarrassing comment.</p></blockquote>

				<p>So, I blogged about it <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/170">here</a>, initially.  This week I&#8217;ve been playing with keyloggers.  I had my keyloggers setup on win2k3 and winxp machines and I was accessing them via RDP.  I made the mistake of keeping my RDP session nailed up.  A few days later, I note tons of entries being displayed within the keylogger GUI.  Of course, since the clipboard auto-synchs between the client machine and the RDP server, the keylogger on the virtual machine had been logging the clipboard contents from my home machine.  I had been doing tons of code edits, so every cut-and-paste was captured and displayed by the keylogger software.  Pretty embarrassing!</p>
<p>Now, what would I find if I setup a machine on a stub network, installed a keyboard logger, and let the hackers come on in?  For everyone attaching to my machine, I would be snagging their clipboard.  That might be interesting data.</p>
<p>!Dmitry

				<p>AmitimA referred me to an interesting fact. Bank Hapoalim, the largest bank in Israel, has a <a href="https://www.bankhapoalim.co.il/wps/portal/PoalimPrivate/products?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/Poalim%20-%20Content/poalimsite/sitearea_poalimbainternet/sitearea_security/poalimbachriotbainternet&#038;WCM_PORTLET=PC_7_RPHBSI420GESD02T348N153G77_WCM&#038;proceed=1"title="Bank Hapoalim" >warranty notice</a> (Hebrew only) on their web site regarding Internet transactions.</p>
<p>Contrary to my (cynical?) expectations the warranty says as follows (apologies for the rough translation):</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is to certify,<br />
that bank Hapoalim provides you a warranty on money transfers out of your account, that were done over the Internet, maliciously, by a 3rd party that was not authorized to operate your account and has done so without your knowledge and without your consent, your approval or with you.</p>
<p>The bank hereby declares that it will credit your account in the identical sum of the amounts that were taken out of your account, within 28 days from the day you sign the event form&#8230;”</p></blockquote>
<p>The only obligation is that you notify them within 28 days of the event, and that you give them reasonable help to assist them in investigating. There is no fine print, no disclaimers and no hidden catches as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I know this is already the informal policy in the Internet-based banking world. It makes sense: Banks want to encourage people to use their Internet banking that is cheap to maintain and support and to do that they swallow online fraud and phishing as the cost of doing business. But this is the first time I&#8217;ve seen a bank step forward and declare this unequivocally.</p>
<p>It seems new to me – when I signed up to online banking with Bank Hapoalim a few years ago I signed a waiver that placed all responsibility on me and practically none on the bank.</p>
<p>Are there any other banks out there that have a similar official policy on their web site? I&#8217;m not asking about the de-facto policy which is obviously the same as above for most banks. I&#8217;m talking about putting a clear and simple notice that they take full responsibility for losses caused by phishing.<br />
Has the online-banking world changed while I wasn&#8217;t looking? Go check your bank&#8217;s official warranty and post the result in the comments below.

				<p>So, I&#8217;m back and now have some time to write about my travel in two amazing security conferences:<br />
Hack in the Box in Dubai and Troopers in Munich</p>
<p>Both conferences are really well organized and with an amazing content! (I&#8217;ll not give my opinion about the each talk, mainly because I have not paid enough attention in important talks).</p>
<p>In HITB the after-conference party was sponsored by Argeniss and was in a boat - amazing drinks and view around Dubai Marina&#8230;  In troopers we went to a typical Germany<br />
place (old era) to eat an amazing meat (pay attention, please&#8230; I&#8217;m Brazilian and I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s an AMAZING meat over there), sponsored by ERNW.</p>
<p>Back to conference content, in both conferences I had enough time to exchange ideas with attendees and speakers&#8230; Troopers received a lot of system administrators from<br />
companies around Germany, which was important to me to better understand the security ideas they have in Germany.  Also, some legal discussions about the new laws in this<br />
country (I&#8217;m better informed now).</p>
<p>HITB Dubai this year was bigger then in the past year, but the CTF game was not so funny (there is no money involved, hehehehe)&#8230;  Our team at Scanit (Oger Systems R&amp;D Lab) won<br />
(to be honest, Chaitanya Sharma from Scanit India passed the Zone-h web challenges steps and Julio Auto the reverse engineering steps - I just gave a lucky hint in the latest one - a off-by-a-few overwrite).</p>
<p>Lots of well known names went to Dubai this year, just to tell some:  Skyper, Cesar Cerrudo, Alexander Kornbrust, Raoul Chiesa, pdp&#8230;</p>
<p>Troopers surprised me!! Really&#8230; It&#8217;s a new conference, but lots of important guys went there:  Alexander Kornbrust, Andrew Cushman, Dan Berstein, Raoul Chiesa, Ariel Waissbein&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m back to Brazil (yeah, I left Scanit) to work @Check Point&#8230; good luck to me, hope to see you guys in some conference (why not Hackers 2 Hackers Conference in Brazil? - http://www.h2hc.org.br).

				<p>OK, I&#8217;m sure that, as usual, I&#8217;m a day late to this party&#8230;but, I&#8217;m having lots of fun with <a href="http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/">Wikiscanner</a> .  It&#8217;s pretty fun to browse around companies that you&#8217;ve worked for and seeing what edits they have been doing on Wiki.  One of the cool things is to look at a company and see when and where they have been editing their Companies wiki (it&#8217;s also funny to see when and where they have been editing their competitions wiki).  Companies want to ensure that the Wiki article reflects well on their company.  After all, a google query for company X will almost always have the Wiki article as one of the top hits.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that this can be used to an attacker&#8217;s favour.  For instance, if you know that the PR folks are monitoring and editing a certain page on the Internet at regular intervals, then you can inject malicious links, code (?), etc. and use it to target the internal user.  What if the wiki page for a large software vendor contained a link to where they could download a demo of the software for free?  Would the PR person know better than to download the software and see what it was?<br />

				<p>As far as facebook is concerned, your email is your identification. This is true for other social networks like linkedin, and is slowly catching on to many other Web 2.0 services. It actually makes a lot of sense that your unique identifier (your &#8220;ID&#8221;) would be your email - it&#8217;s unique by definition, it&#8217;s easy to remember and most services need the email information anyway (for example, to send you a password reset). So combining the &#8216;email&#8217; and &#8216;username&#8217; fields makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Unlike in the past where users switched emails frequently, we now have hotmail and gmail and personalized accounts that we can take with us as we switch jobs or ISPs. Email is private (at least, as private as snail mail) and if my bank feels comfortable sending me alerts and other information over email, than it is definitely secure enough for the rest of us.<br />
So if email is destined to become the equivalent of your social security number or identification number (depending on which country you live in) how do we proof check that the email address we typed does not contain any typos? Most identification numbers have a controlling digit that acts like a checksum to make sure the ID was typed correctly. With email, we don&#8217;t have that and so you&#8217;re sending an email with the newest Vista joke to your coworker friend Bill Howards over at the Vista team and your finger slips and the mail goes to billg@microsoft.com.</p>
<p>Or worse - with gmail I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1026">receiving emails</a> that belonged to some other Aviram that was too slow to catch aviram@gmail before I did. Most of this misguided email ranges from boring to funny, but today I got a purchase confirmation with the order number, amount and last 4 digits of the CC number. Since I &#8220;own&#8221; the email that is associated with this account, what prevents me from logging in to this guy&#8217;s account (have the e-commerce site send the password to &#8220;my&#8221; email due to my temporary amnesia) and redirecting the order to another zip code that happens to be my house?</p>
<p>Sure, I would never do that to a fellow Aviram. But what happens when our possible-future-Internet ID,  our email, is typed wrong into some government database and all our IRS information, special Internet-voting code and who-knows-what-else is sent to our alternate identity, the guy that lives right by us on the keyboard? Not good.</p>
<p>My receiving another person&#8217;s order information is an obvious lesson for web sites: Make sure you verify the email address. Sending a test email and waiting for confirmation is good security practice since you&#8217;re not only confirming the person typed his email address correctly but you&#8217;re also confirming he did not sign up his mother in law to your wonderful daily adult joke service as pay back for last thanksgiving.

				<p>Some of the best security solutions come from people who have a passion for security and want to make the Internet a better/safer place. We started <a href="http://www.securiteam.com">SecuriTeam</a> as a place for people like us, who want to read security information that was collected, processed and edited. The <a href="http://osvdb.org/">OSVDB</a> team wanted to answer the need for a standard, open catalog of information. Nmap, nessus, snort and many many other useful tools and projects were all passions that turned into something millions of security professionals use regularly.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the money. Most of these projects need money to keep on going. The people behind them need to pay the bills. Sometimes just a little ad or sponsorship is enough, and other times the writers want to be compensated for their hard work and make a living (or get rich) from the project they gave so much time and energy to.<br />
This is where the lines get blurry: Fyodor insists on keeping nmap open source and non-commercial. Tenable closed nessus in a very controversial move and SourceFire is able to carefully do the open-source/commercial tango with snort. In Beyond Security, we have a constant struggle on how to keep the commercial products and the community services separate, but in synergy. I don&#8217;t even know if we&#8217;re doing it right (but god knows we&#8217;re trying).</p>
<p>But other times the line isn&#8217;t blurry at all. Like watching a train wreck in slow motion, we are regularly seeing how a good project morphs into a twisted corporate disaster. PCI-DSS is probably the best example.<br />
PCI-DSS started with the good idea of forcing web sites to check themselves for security holes on regular basis, a notion initiated by the credit card companies in an honest attempt to improve the security of web sites (since they had the most to lose; credit card fraud hurts the issuer no matter who ultimately pays for it). But this good idea went to bad and then to worse as the PCI-DSS went completely commercial - on one hand the organization wanted as many vendors to sign up for their PCI-DSS certification services so that they can make their money and on the other hand the web site operators were paying money to get the PCI certification without really caring what that meant as long as someone was willing to give it to them for some dough. Russ has <a rel="nofollow" href="http://holisticinfosec.blogspot.com/2008/05/why-pci-is-doomed.html">a good writeup</a> on where PCI-DSS is going. I agree with everything he&#8217;s saying.</p>
<p>And now there&#8217;s CVE - one of my favorite projects of all time. I know the project well, and we even got the &#8220;CVE Certification&#8221; a while back. True, not something that will help you get laid, but on the other hand getting the certification was one of the most pleasant experiences we had in that area. Nobody likes to be judged and thus nobody likes to be &#8216;certified&#8217; by others - but the CVE certification process really wasn&#8217;t about &#8216;judging&#8217; us. At least that&#8217;s not what it felt like.</p>
<p>This morning I asked the guys in Beyond Security who were involved in the certification process what made the good feeling that remained. Their answer was that people we talked to at Mitre weren&#8217;t sales people (CVE certification is free, they don&#8217;t even charge for the picture frames) but rather technical people from the CVE team that actually wanted CVE to be &#8220;good&#8221;. Talking to someone who both has a clue and cares enough to show it is the difference between Mastercard&#8217;s SDP and the new PCI-DSS.</p>
<p>So why am I worried about CVE which is still alive, kicking and putting some sanity in the dozens of weekly security hole announcements? Because just last week we got this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Date: Wed, 7 May 2008 10:40:49<br />
To: xxxxx@beyondsecurity.com<br />
Cc:&#8221;Doe, Jane&#8221;<br />
Subject: CVE</p>
<p>XXXXX,<br />
SAIC received confirmation from NIST that SCAP CVE and OVAL testing will be operational by the end of May 2008.  By the end of this week, NIST will issue the updated requirements document that will add more requirements for CVE testing.</p>
<p>When SCAP first went operational CVE and OVAL were deferred because the test requirements in those areas were not complete.  Historically, MITRE conducted CVE testing.  CVE testing has now transitioned over to SCAP laboratories.</p>
<p>If you desire further SCAP information or about CVE and OVAL testing, or a cost proposal, please contact me.</p>
<p>John Doe,<br />
SAIC AT&#038;E Laboratories Communications Director<br />
410.XXX.XXXX</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to admit I had to read it a few times just to understand what they actually want (although I&#8217;m still not sure). Let me make a few wild speculations:</p>
<p>1. NIST will release an updated requirements to make sure all existing CVE certified products are no longer certified. It will not be exactly clear from the new requirements, so they will change the name to MVP just to make sure.</p>
<p>2. The new CVE will be a set of incomprehensible requirements for anyone without a law degree and will make the PCI requirements document look like a children&#8217;s book.</p>
<p>2. SAIC will suddenly realize they are not a not-for-profit organization and charge $10,000 for a CVE certification and a $7,500 renewal fee to cover the cost of the &#8220;SCAP&#8221; lab.</p>
<p>3. CVE certification will be open to everybody: Consultants will hurry to get &#8220;CVE certified&#8221; and while nobody will really know what that means, as soon as the check clears the certification plaque will be FedEx&#8217;d to them. Linkedin recruitment messages will read &#8220;need CVE expert to help pass a CVE certification test&#8221;.</p>
<p>4. John Doe from the email will call, mail and snail-mail to sign us up at &#8220;special terms&#8221; and &#8220;before the cost goes up&#8221;</p>
<p>5. Sponsorships to the annual CVE conference in San Francisco will sell like hotcakes. The MITRE team will not be invited, but the Director of Lab Services in SAIC will be the keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m probably wrong. Too much fiber for breakfast and not enough red meat for lunch makes me cranky and negative.<br />
Here&#8217;s the more likely scenario: CVE certification will remain free and open and the SAIC guys doing the testing will be excellent security professionals who are regular bugtraq contributors. The PCI council will release the re-re-reclarification of section 6.6 of the PCI 1.1 and that re-re-reclarification will be a one-liner with no references to other requirements. The Ozone layer will heal and electric cars will roam the streets. Real soon now.

				<p>I&#8217;m hyped!  The much-anticipated Maltego version 2.0 is out.  I had previously alluded to maltego <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1042">here</a>.  To the 1% of you who haven&#8217;t heard of Maltego, it&#8217;s a tool for determining relationships between domains, users, email addresses, etc.  I can&#8217;t think of an Infosec or traditional corporate security group which wouldn&#8217;t benefit from this tool.  Check out new features <a href="http://www.paterva.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.paterva.com/maltego/">here</a>.</p>
<p>OK, everyone is probably familiar with the riddle put forth by Samson.  e.g. &#8220;From the eater came forth food; and from the strong came forth sweet.&#8221;. The answer to that riddle was hidden.  Who could have guessed the meaning?  The strength of the riddle was in the fact that it was based on subjective knowledge that only Samson possessed.  Of course, the story ends badly due to philistine subterfuge&#8230;but, I digress.  I know that the security industry puts forth much effort in solving the riddle of &#8220;spam&#8221;.  Question one, would a person, solving the spam riddle, be best served in keeping the answer to himself?  It would seem that any sort of public solution would give the spammer equal opportunity to adjust their attack vector.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about spam.  Google (and their gmail app) seem to know a lot about spam <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  .  Joe Stewart over at Secureworks knows a lot about spam.  He claims that the top botnets can send over <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/www.secureworks.com/research/threats/topbotnets/">100 billion spams per day</a>.  I have a few more ignorant questions:</p>
<p>2) Spam is a nuisance.  Can the power of spam be harnessed and used against ones enemies?  If spam is the &#8220;eater&#8221;, how can it be used to ones advantage?</p>
<p>3) The sending of spam seems highly automated.  Can the power of spam be turned inward?  Like a child scooping cuploads of black ants on a red ant mount, is there a way of causing a &#8220;war&#8221; between spambots?  Would such a war benefit anyone?</p>

				<p>The Daily WTF <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Super-Hacker.aspx">has a good story</a> that may sound a little too familiar to some:</p>
<blockquote><p>How the aptly-named Super Hacker had managed to shut down the system remotely and provide a fix so quickly intrigued Kiefer. After poking around the network, he finally found the Python file that contained the Super Hacker&#8217;s fix:<br />
#!usr/bin/python<br />
# Paying someone $10 to pull a power cord for $3500<br />
print &#8220;(C) [Name Removed]  2008.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The moral of the story: when all else fails, use social engineering.

				<p>New week a new question, in this case the question is a bit more generic and I believe raises a few dilemmas, feel free to take a shot at it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Experts,</p>
<p>Is it secure to just configure Cisco IPSEC/GRE site to site tunnel without firewall/IPS/IDS. The argument here is although it is internet facing, there is only a host to host routing between the routers and the default route goes to the tunnel. Am I right to say that it is technically secure since the router only route traffic between the designated routers?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
J. O.</p></blockquote>

				<p>Another one for you this week, we especially liked XenoMuta&#8217;s answer to our previous one.<br />
Lets go:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear SecuriTeam,</p>
<p>i am not sure if you are able to help us to find a solution for a special problem but i&#8217;ve tried everything and spent a lot of time in the internet without any achievement.</p>
<p>we want to export the content of multiple exchange servers from our branch offices into personal folders (.pst files) and import these informations into our exchange mail system. the main problem why we are not yet able to do this is that we want to scan the content for viruses, worms (if possible with multiple virus scanners) and for unwanted content like videos, music, executables and so on and this in a way that a real content scan would be done instead of just checking against the file extension. also all attached archives (zip, rar etc.) should be opened (if possible) and scanned for its content. if an attachment is found which cannot be scanned because of password protection or encryption or whatever reason this attachment or the complete mail should be deleted or moved to a quarantine area.</p>
<p>Thank your very much for your support</p>
<p>Best regards<br />
J. B.<br />
Germany</p></blockquote>

				<p>Anyone who has ever done serious security research reached the line that separates good from evil. If you are working with phishing emails you get links to kiddie porn. If you research security holes you deal with exploits. If you are researching botnets you are up to your neck in sensitive information that was obtained illegally.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sometimes asked if we ever get &#8216;tempted&#8217; to cross over. The answer is simple: we may think like criminals and sometimes emulate their work, but it never ever enters our mind to do something malicious. Finding an SQL injections that gives you full access to the database is fun; using this information to steal money or order items for free is light years away from what we do.</p>
<p>But not everyone understands that, and that&#8217;s scary. A member of the THC <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.thc.org/index.php?/archives/1-GSM-Researcher-stopped-at-Heathrow-Airport-by-UK-government-officials.html">got pulled over at Heathrow airport by the UK government</a>. The story has a happy ending, but it must have been scary, not to mention frustrating. My good friend Zvi Gutterman found weaknesses in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/419">Windows</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/10812/34091/01624027.pdf?isnumber=34091&#038;prod=CNF&#038;arnumber=1624027&#038;arSt=+15+pp.&#038;ared=&#038;arAuthor=Gutterman%2C+Z.%3B+Pinkas%2C+B.%3B+Reinman%2C+T.">Linux</a> PRNG. Breaking the PRNG has consequences - while top-secret crypto systems will not use the standard Windows or Linux random number generators, who knows if there is a simple Linux based basic communication device used in one of the governments? An applicable weakness in the PRNG may have a serious impact and they might decide that shutting up Zvi is easier than replacing all their units.</p>
<p>If you think the previous paragraph is a paranoid conspiracy theory, lets talk about kiddie porn links. These pop up whenever we deal with botnets, phishing and malware. The police is trying to demonstrate zero tolerance for kiddie porn, usually by arresting anyone who has visited such an illegal web site. How will you explain to your family, when they see you on the 8 o&#8217;clock news arrested for kiddie porn charges, that you are not a dangerous paedophile but you had no idea the link you clicked was to a kiddie porn site?</p>
<p>There will be more incidents like the THC one. We can all tell the difference between a proof of concept device to show how vulnerable GSM encryption is and an illegal wiretapping device. But the law officials can&#8217;t, and often don&#8217;t seem to care about the difference. Some of the time it&#8217;s not even law officials: <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/803">Fyodor had his site shut down</a> to prevent spreading his nmap &#8216;hacking tool&#8217;. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cryptome.org/usa-v-sklyarov.htm">Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested in Las Vegas</a> for breaking the PDF encryption. In the Fyodor incident the decision was made by godaddy. In the Dmitry Skylarov case it was Adobe who got the court order.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t want to see security research being a licensed profession (like a private detective license or a license to carry a firearm) - I&#8217;ve seen brilliant teenagers who think out of the box and find vulnerabilities no one else can, but are not old enough to drive a car. So what else can we do to make sure we hold a &#8216;get out of jail&#8217; card?

				<p>Once again - another security question from our readers to the security experts who read this blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>I ran across your site looking for information regarding the security of PPTP.  I then found the PPTP bruter program from THC.  I am a small business owner.  I am a VAR (value added reseller) of POS (point of sale) equipment.  My POS equipment is usually windows PC’s running POS software.  I install a SOHO router that is also a PPTP endpoint so I can VPN in and remotely administrator my clients systems.</p>
<p>I’m trying to find out how easy it would be for someone to hack my PPTP endpoint. Can you help me figure out how to test my router?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>K. L.</p></blockquote>
