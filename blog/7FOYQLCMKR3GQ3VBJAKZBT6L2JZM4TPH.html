				<p>Galina Pildush ended her LTE presentation with a very good question:&#8221;Who is responsible for LTE security?  Is it the users? UE (User Equipment, handsets and devices) manufacturers and vendors?  Network providers, operators and telcos?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great question, and one that needs to be applied to every area of security.</p>
<p>In the SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) and personal sphere, it has long been assumed that it&#8217;s the user who is responsible.  Long assumed, but possibly changing.  Apple, particularly with the iOS/iPhone/iPad lines, has moved toward a model where the vendor (Apple) locks down the device, and only allows you certain options for software and services.  Not all of them are produced or provided by Apple, but Apple gets vetting responsibilities and rights.</p>
<p>The original &#8220;user&#8221; responsibility model has not worked particularly well.  Most people don&#8217;t know how to protect themselves in regard to information security.  Malware and botnets are rampant.  In the &#8220;each man for himself&#8221; situation, many users do not protect themselves, with significant consequences for the computing environment as a whole.  (For years I have been telling corporations that they should support free, public security awareness training.  Not as advertising or for goodwill, but as a matter of self defence.  Reducing the number of infected users out there will reduce the level of risk in computing and communication as a whole.)</p>
<p>The &#8220;vendor&#8221; model, in Apple&#8217;s case (and Microsoft seems to be trying to move in that direction) has generated a reputation, at least, for better security.  Certainly infection and botnet membership rates appear to be lower in Macs than in Windows machines, and lower still in the iOS world.  (This, of course, does nothing to protect the user from phishing and other forms of fraud.  In fact, it would be interesting to see if users in a &#8220;walled garden&#8221; world were slightly more susceptible to fraud, since they were protected from other threats and had less need to be paranoid.)  The model also has significant advantages as a business model, where you can lock in users (and providers, as well), so it is obviously going to be popular with the vendors.</p>
<p>Of course, there are drawbacks, for the vendors, in this model.  As has been amply demonstrated in current mobile network situations, providers are very late in rolling out security patches.  This is because of the perception that the entire responsibility rests with the provider, and they want to test every patch to death before releasing it.  If that role falls to the vendors, they too will have to take more care, probably <em><strong>much</strong></em> more care, to ensure software is secure.  And that will delay both patch cycles and version cycles.</p>
<p>Which, of course, brings us to the providers.  As noted, there is already a problem here with patch releases.  But, after all, most attacks these days are network based.  Proper filtering would not only deal with intrusions and malware, but also issues like spam and fraud.  After all, if the phishing message never reaches the user, the user can&#8217;t be defrauded.</p>
<p>So, in theory, we can make a good case that the provider would be the most effective locus for responsibility for security.  They have the ability to address the broadest range of security issues.  In reality, of course, it wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>In the first place, all kinds of users wouldn&#8217;t stand for it.  Absent a monopoly market, any provider who tried to provide total security protection, would a) incur prohibitively heavy costs (putting pressure on their competitive rates), and b) lose a bunch of users who would resent restrictions and limitations.  (At present, of course, me know that many providers can get away with being <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1630" target="_blank">pretty cavalier</a> about security.)  The providers would also, as now, have to deal with a large range of devices.  And, if responsibility is lifted from the vendors, the situation will only get worse: vendors will be able to role out new releases and take even less care with testing than they do now.</p>
<p>In practical terms, we probably can&#8217;t, and shouldn&#8217;t decide this question.  All parties should take some responsibility, and all parties should take more than they do currently.  That way, everybody will be better off.  But, as <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1598" target="_blank">Bruce Schneier</a> notes, there are always going to be those who try and shirk their responsibility, relying on the fact that others will not.</p>

				<p>LTE.  Even the name is complex: Long-Term Evolution of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network</p>
<p>All LTE phones (UE, User Equipment) are running servers.  Multiple servers.  (And almost all are unsecured at the moment.)</p>
<p>Because of the proliferation of protocols (GSM, GPRS, CDMA, additional 3 and 4G, and now LTE), the overall complexity of the mobile/cell cloud is growing.</p>
<p>LTE itself is fairly complex.  The Protocol Reference Model contains at least the GERAN User Plane, UTRAN User Plane, and E-UTRAN User Plane (all with multiple components) as well as the control plane.  A simplified model of a connection request involves at least nine messages involving six entities, with two more sitting on the sides.  The transport layer, SCTP, has a four-way, rather than two-way, handshake.  (Hence the need for all those servers.)  Basically, though, LTE is IP, but a fairly complex set of additional protocols, as opposed to the old PSTN.  The old public telephone network was a walled garden which few understood.  Just about all the active blackhats today understand IP, and it&#8217;s open.  It&#8217;s protected by Diameter, but even the Diameter implementation was loopholes.  It has a tunnelling protocol, GTP (GPRS Tunnelling Protocol), but, like very many tunnelling protocols, GTP does not provide confidentiality or integrity protection.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to the extra speed, functions, interconnection abilities, and apps.  But all the functionality means a much larger attack surface.  The total infrastructure involved in LTE is more complex.  Maybe nobody can know it all.  But they can know enough to start messing with it.  From a simple DoS to DDoS, false billing, disclosure of data, malware, botnets of the UEs, spam, SMS trojans, even run down batteries, you name it.</p>
<p>As with VoIP before it, we are rolling our known data vulnerabilities, and known voice/telco/PBX vulnerabilities, into one big insecurity.</p>

				<p>Let me say, right off the top, that I love CanSecWest.  I am tired of &#8220;vendor&#8221; conferences, where you pay outrageous fees for the privilege of sitting through a bunch of sales pitches.  At least CanSecWest has real information, as opposed to virtual information.  (Virtual information: n. &#8211; marketing spiel dressed up as actual technical information.)</p>
<p>However, today I have had the same conversation half a dozen times, with half a dozen different people.  (And I didn&#8217;t initiate any of them.)  The conversation generally starts out the same way, with the question, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think CanSecWest is getting &#8230; less technical?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it may simply be a one year glitch, or a random set of presentations.  But, yes, I have to agree that, so far, the presentations have not been as great as in the past.</p>
<p>Still good, don&#8217;t get me wrong.  But we started with a pres on the boot process, nicely technical, but nothing new.  Pen testing, which was also pretty generic, and nothing new.  The <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1627" target="_blank">social authentication</a>, yes, that was good.  Recent research, and some neat ideas to play with.  The piece on <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1503" target="_blank">APT</a> was mostly about finding bugs in Shockwave/Flash.  The piece on Duqu and Stuxnet was good, but I feel a bit used: Kaspersky obviously timed it to present the same thing at both CanSecWest and CeBit at the same time.  Good PR hack, but a bit of a cheat in terms of &#8220;unique&#8221; presentations that haven&#8217;t been done before.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1633" target="_blank">smartphone rooting</a> had some interesting points, but didn&#8217;t demonstrate real exploits.  The <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1639" target="_blank">probing of mobile networks</a> had more real and technical data.  (Marcia Hoffman&#8217;s presentation was, last year, a personal disappointment to me, since I&#8217;m a legal and forensics guy, and expected more depth.  However, when I thought about it, I realized that she had nailed the target audience: these guys are geeks, and need the basic warnings about what they are doing.  She did just as well this year.)</p>
<p>The iOS exploitation pres was interesting but covered material that was covered quite well last year.  The piece on hardware-involved attacks boiled down to &#8220;if you don&#8217;t take care with your programming, hardware can do things you don&#8217;t expect: be a careful programmer.&#8221;  The Near Field Communications (NFC) item did raise some interesting points about the careless acceptance of chip codes, but most of it was little different from discussions about RFID or validating input in general.  (The <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1648" target="_blank">HDMI</a> was pretty cool.)</p>
<p>Like I said, I love CanSecWest, and I&#8217;m still going to come.  I may complain a bit about these presentations, but they are still far above anything you are likely to find at a vendor conference.  But I hope the program gets back to some solid, new technical stuff.</p>
<p>(By the way, if you want more details about the specific presentations, the slides are generally made available in an <a href="http://cansecwest.com/pastevents.html" target="_blank">archive</a> shortly after the event closes.  It&#8217;ll probably be <a href="http://cansecwest.com/csw12archive.html" target="_blank">this link</a>, or something similar.)</p>

				<p>Displays are monitors, right?  Strictly output, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>DVI and HDMI both support DDC, which allows for display identification and &#8220;capability advertisement.&#8221;  In other words, the display is sending information to the computer.  HDMI also has capabilities for &#8220;content protection,&#8221; and even has an ethernet channel.</p>
<p>And, of course, all these capabilities provide for neat ways to create trouble &#8230;  Lots of data comes from the display, and it has to be parsed.  And any time you are parsing data, you are, in a way, following instructions from outside the machine.</p>
<p>(Does anyone&#8217;s display programming take care not to trust the data coming from &#8220;the display&#8221;?  Care to take a guess, based on past experience?)</p>
<p>The data flying back and forth has a definite format: EDID.  There are standards.  Care to guess what can happen when you mess with the EDID data?  (And there are lots of ways it can get messed up unintentionally, starting with a simple KVM switch.)</p>
<p>In one case, experimenting was able to shut off system logging.  In another, EDID fuzzing was able to cause instability in the kernel.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve seen one in my own machine: on Win 7 and this hardware, plugging and unplugging USBs can shut off video feed to the display.  In two cases, attempting to recover the display crashed the system, hard.)</p>

				<p>Mobile networks have many disparate types of devices.  You can probably guess what some of them are, or even go to the provider&#8217;s store or kiosk and get a list.  But there are going to be more devices out there.  So why not scan the IP addresses on your subnet?</p>
<p>Well, the access points for mobile networks generally don&#8217;t allow promiscuous access.  So you may have to go to ARIN and other lists in order to start getting some ranges to check.  You can also check access logs of a Website to find visitors with mobile devices.  (Of course, there is always the NATting that the providers do, not to mention DHCP, and the fact that most mobile devices don&#8217;t run servers or services.)</p>
<p>Colin Mulliner, of the Berlin Institute of Technology, did manage to find a fair amount of interesting stuff.  Windows Mobile tended to be a useful source of open ports and services (usually open FTP services on mobile devices).  He also found and was able to identify a number of specialized devices that were identifiable from responses to probes.  Some of the most interesting were mobile access points: connecting to the mobile networks and then providing local wifi for computers.  Others were HTTP servers for surveillance cameras.  (Others were GPS tracking devices which, oddly, had no security against &#8220;guest&#8221; login  :-)  (Some were smart meters.  With smart meters rolling out here in BC, lets hope they are more secure &#8230;)</p>
<p>Possibly of concern was the large number of jailbroken iOS devices.  Many of them still had the default &#8220;alpine&#8221; password.  (If you hack your own device, you&#8217;d better be prepared to secure it.)  This could form the basis of a fair sized worm and/or botnet.  Then again, iOS users aren&#8217;t alone here.  An awful lot of people seem to think nothing of creating mobile devices and hooking them up to mobile networks with very little in the way of security.</p>

				<p>Scott Kelly, platform architect at Netflix, gets to look at a lot of devices.  In depth.  He&#8217;s got some interesting things to say about smartphones.  (At CanSecWest.)</p>
<p>First of all, with a computer, you are the &#8220;tenant.&#8221;  You own the machine, and you can modify it any way you want.</p>
<p>On a smartphone, you are not the only tenant, and, in fact, you are the second tenant.  The provider is the first.  And where you may want to modify and customize it, the provider may not want you to.  They&#8217;d like to lock you in.  At the very least, they want to maintain some control because you are constantly on their network.</p>
<p>Now, you can root or jailbreak your phone.  Basically, that means hacking your phone.  Whether you do that or not, it does mean that your device is hackable.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the system architectures for smartphones can be hugely complex.)</p>
<p>Sometimes you can simply replace the firmware.  Providers try to avoid doing that, sometimes looking at a secure boot system.  This is usually the same as the &#8220;trusted computing&#8221; (digital signatures that verify back to a key that is embedded in the hardware) or &#8220;trusted execution&#8221; (operation restriction) systems.  (Both types were used way back in AV days of old.)  Sometimes the providers ask manufacturers to lock the bootloader.  Attackers can get around this, sometimes letting a check succeed and then doing a swap, or attacking write protection, or messing with the verification process as it is occurring.  However, you can usually find easier implementation errors.  Sometimes providers/vendors use symmetric enryption: once a key is known, every device of that model is accessible.  You can also look at the attack surface, and with the complex architectures in smartphones the surface is enormous.</p>
<p>Vendors and providers are working towards trusted modules and trustzones in mobile devices.  Sometimes this is virtual, sometimes it actually involves hardware.  (Personally, I saw attempts at this in the history of malware.  Hardware tended to have inherent advantages, but every system I saw had some vulnerability somewhere.)</p>
<p>Patching has been a problem with mobile devices.  Again, the providers are going to be seen as responsible for ongoing operation.  Any problems are going to be seen as their fault.  Therefore, they really have to be sure that any patch they create is absolutely bulletproof.  It can&#8217;t create any problems.  So there is always going to be a long window for any exploit that is found.  And there are going to be vulnerabilities to exploit in a system this complex.  Providers and vendors are going to keep trying to lock systems.</p>
<p>(Again, personally, I suspect that hacks will keep on occurring, and that the locking systems will turn out to be less secure than the designers think.)</p>
<p>Scott is definitely a good speaker, and his slides and flow are decent.  However, most of the material he has presented is fairly generic.  CanSecWest audiences have come to expect revelations of real attacks.</p>

				<p>So, I&#8217;m always excited about CanSecWest, and I was yesterday, as I got ready.  I went to do a last minute download of email.  (Yes, the conference provides wireless, and it usually works, after a few initial glitches.  But I like to avoid risks, and I like to have most of my stuff with me on my machine.)</p>
<p>I could pull the email off my main account.  (I have multiple email addresses with Shaw.)  But I couldn&#8217;t get any email off the subsidiary accounts.  In order to check if this was some setting gone wrong on my MUA I tried the Web interface.  Same result: I could get at my main account, but not the subsidiary accounts.</p>
<p>Later in the day, at the conference, I was able to access all the accounts.  But I found that, while my main account was still accessible though the original interface, suddenly all the others were using a new &#8220;Webmail 2.0.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought this was kind of odd, so I reported this to Shaw through their &#8220;ShawHelp&#8221; account on Twitter.  You can&#8217;t explain a lot in 140 characters, so we passed a few &#8220;direct messages&#8221; back and forth.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1483" target="_blank">previously</a> <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1484" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1485" target="_blank">Shaw&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1486" target="_blank">support</a> is not the best, and their <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1507" target="_blank">attitude</a> to <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1513" target="_blank">security</a> could use some work.  (As a side result of this, a friend has provided me with an emergency proxy for outbound email.  I tried it this morning, and, unlike Shaw, which requires that you be on their network before you get access to your email, it works from CanSecWest.)  So I shouldn&#8217;t have been shocked when I got a message from ShawHelp saying &#8230; well, let me quote it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not seeing issues with either of them. You can&#8217;t log into cissp? What is password so we can take a look? ^LL&#8221;</p>
<p>I had forgotten this.  In the old days, when I stilled tried to call Shaw support when I had a problem, I frequently got asked for my password.  Since I won&#8217;t give them my password (what do you think I am, a normal user?), that usually ended any attempt on their part to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>So, here we are, some years later, and Shaw is still asking their customers for passwords.  How many years have we been telling people, &#8220;customer support will never ask you for your password&#8221;?</p>
<p>On a very slightly positive note, I can say that, two months after they announced it, the Shaw Wifi AP in Lynn Valley is finally operating.</p>
<p>(I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t bash too hard on Shaw.  Their tech support and security is abysmal, but the service only goes down about once a quarter.  The other day I was at the barbershop.  They are putting in service through the other major provider in our area, Telus.  Telus&#8217; initial installation had only given them partial access, so they called in Telus&#8217; support.  The support tech managed to shut off access completely, and had been coming back, sporadically, for over a week, without success.)  (Yes, I did manage to get them partial access back &#8230;)</p>

				<p>Well, <em><strong>I</strong></em> thought it was ironic that the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204781804577267532079716926.html?mod=e2tw" target="_blank">biggest solar storm in years</a> is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/9129749/Huge-solar-flare-to-hit-Earth.html" target="_blank">hitting the earth tonight</a> &#8230; while CanSecWest is on &#8230;</p>
<p>So far today we have had talks on security (and vulnerabilities) during the boot process, a talk on pen testing (and the presenter seemed to be alternately talking about how to choose a pen tester, and how to do pen testing), and social authentication.</p>
<p>The social authentication talk was by Alex Rice from Facebook.  He noted that, even though Facebook only challenges a small fraction of a percent of logins, given the user base that means more then a million every day.  When a login is challenged, a standard response has been the good old &#8220;security questions&#8221;: mother&#8217;s maiden name, birthdate, and other pieces of information that might not be too hard for someone intent on breaking into your account to find out.</p>
<p>Alex went through the limitations of security questions, and then moved to other possibilities.  Security questions comes under the heading of &#8220;things you know,&#8221; so they looked at &#8220;things you have.&#8221;  For example, you have to have an email address, so there is the possibility of a challenge sent to your email.  (Google, of course, figures that everyone in the world has a cell phone that can receive text messages.)</p>
<p>Recently, Facebook has started to use the photos that people post on their pages, particularly those that have been tagged.  Basically, if your login gets challenged, you will be shown a series of pictures, and you should be able to identify who is, or is not, in the picture, out of your list of friends.  This is the subject of a <a href="http://crosslandteam.com/blog/2010/08/29/my-facebook-login-lockout-ordeal-and-how-i-prevailed/" target="_blank">blog post noting that it isn&#8217;t perfect</a>.</p>
<p>There are additional problems.  As the post notes, the situation is less than ideal if you have a huge number of &#8220;friends.&#8221;  (As <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1598" target="_blank">Bruce Schneier&#8217;s new book</a> notes, if you have more than 150 friends, you probably aren&#8217;t friends with many of them.)  Even if you do know your &#8220;friends,&#8221; there is nothing to say that any given picture of them will be recognizable.  In fact, since the system relies on tagging, there are going to be pictures of weird objects that people have deliberately tagged as themselves, in joking fashion.</p>
<p>Therefore, this system is definitely not perfect, as the questions at the end pointed out.  Unfortunately, Alex had passed, rather quickly, over an important point.  The intent of the system, in Facebook&#8217;s opinion, was to reduce the amount of account spam sent via accounts that had been compromised.  In that regard, the system probably works very well.  False logins get challenged.  Some of the challenges are false positives.  The photo system is a means of allowing a portion (a fairly large portion, probably) of users to recover their accounts quickly.  For the remaining accounts, there are other means to recover the account, even though these are more time-consuming for both Facebook and the user.  This system does reduce the total amount of time spent by both users (in the aggregate, even if individual users may feel hard done by) and Facebook.</p>

<p>I had the chance to hang out at the SECCDC yesterday at Kennesaw State Univ.  For those not familiar with these events (I wasn&#8217;t either, until yesterday), you have colleges who bring in teams to defend against a &#8216;red team&#8217;.  UNC Charlotte defended their network better than the other colleges.  It was interesting to see these schools throwing in block filters, redirects, etc. on the fly.  Impressive from a bunch of college students.  The red team was equally impressive.  There wasn&#8217;t a box that they didn&#8217;t, at some point, root thoroughly&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One interesting note.  During the competition, there was a full power outage.  UPSes died.  Images were lost.  Router configs were killed.  It generally set the entire competition back a few hours (at least).  Just a reminder that physical security is every bit as important as the logical security&#8230;.</p>

				<p>I always look forward to <a href="http://cansecwest.com/" target="_blank">CanSecWest</a>.  Usually cutting edge stuff.  Some of it incomprehensible, some of it interesting, some very entertaining.</p>
<p>Every year is a different program, of course, but every year has some changes to the setup, as well.  This year is the latest I can remember them opening the doors to the ballroom/theatre, but it was also one of the earliest in terms of starting the registrations.</p>
<p>Between getting registered and getting in to the room there&#8217;s some time to mingle.  It was nice to see old friends, including some whose presence surprised me.  Also nice to meet a few new people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always interesting who you run into at CanSecWest.  One friend, on his first time out, sat down next to a nice chap, and got to talking.  Said chap shortly asked my friend to mind his computer for the next little while, then walked up to the front and was introduced as the next speaker, Charlie Miller.  Miller is a bit of a fixture at the event, as he tends to win the Pwn2Own contest year after year.  You&#8217;ve probably heard of his escapades in other areas.</p>
<p>(As I say, lots of nice people here.  However, this is definitely a conference on the geek end of the spectrum, and you can often count on running into people whose &#8220;people skills&#8221; could use work.  It makes starting up conversations with strangers possibly more surprising than usual  :-)</p>
<p>Not as many vendors at CanSecWest as at other conferences.  Some interesting ones this year: one company doing managed security and reselling.  They are looking at the enterprise and government market, and I suspect they may be at the wrong conference.  Adobe is here: they seem to be trying to overcome the perception of them as the problem.  A number of companies appear to be primarily interested in recruiting.  (If they are really serious about it, they might have sent more technical people: a number of tables are staffed by sales people who are having difficulty talking to the geeks they are trying to recruit.)</p>
<p>As usual, getting connected to the CanSecWest network was a bit of a challenge, but I seem to be on now  :-)</p>

				<p>OK, having now had this conversation twice, I&#8217;ve gone back to the true source of all wisdom on all things viral, &#8220;Viruses Revealed.&#8221;  I got it off my shelf, of course, but some helpful vxer (who probably thought he was going to harm our sales) <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/ars08.html" target="_blank">posted it on the net</a>, and saved David and I the bother.  (Remember, this guy is a vxer, so that page may not be entirely safe.)</p>
<p>Michelangelo is covered between pages 357 and 361, which is slightly over halfway through the book.  However, since I guess he&#8217;s missed out the index and stuff, it turns out to be at about the 3/4 mark on the page he&#8217;s created.</p>
<p>Anyway, Michelangelo checks the date via Interrupt 1Ah.  many people did not understand the difference between the MS-DOS clock and the system clock read by Interrupt 1Ah. The MS-DOS DATE command did not always alter the system clock. Network-connected machines often have &#8220;time server&#8221; functions so that the date is reset to conform to the network. The year 1992 was a leap year, and many clocks did not deal with it properly. Thus, for many computers, 6th March came on Thursday, not Friday.</p>

				<p>Graham Cluley, of <a href="http://www.sophos.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Sophos</a> and <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/" target="_blank">Naked Security</a>, posted some <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/03/05/michelangelo-virus/" target="_blank">reminiscences of the Michelangelo virus</a>.  It brought back some memories and he&#8217;s told the story well.</p>
<p>I hate to argue with Graham, but, first off, I have to note that the twentieth anniversary of Micelangelo is not tomorrow (March 6, 2012), but today, March 5.  That&#8217;s because 1992 was, as this year is, a leap year.  Yes, Michelangelo was timed to go off on March 6th every year, but, due to a shortcut in the code (and bugs in normal comptuer software), it neglected to factor in leap years.  Therefore, in 1992 many copies went off a day early, on March 5th.</p>
<p>March 5th, 1992, was a rather busy day for me.  I was attending a seminar, but kept getting called out to answer media enquiries.</p>
<p>And then there was the fact that, after all that work and information submitted to the media in advance, and creating copies of Michelangelo on a 3 1/2&#8243; disk (it would normally only infect 5 1/4&#8243;s) so I could test it on a safe machine (and then having to recreate the disk when I accidentally triggered the virus), it wasn&#8217;t me who got my picture in the paper.  No, it was my baby brother, who a) didn&#8217;t believe in the virus, but b) finally, at literally the eleventh hour (11 pm on March 4th) decided to scan his own computer (with a scanner I had given to him), and, when he found he was infected, raised the alarm with his church, and scanned their computers as well.  (Must have been pretty close to midnight, and zero hour, by that time.)  That&#8217;s a nice human interest story so <em><strong>he</strong></em> got his picture in the paper.  (Not that I&#8217;m bitter, mind you.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite agree with Graham as to the infection rates.  I do know that, since this was the first time we (as the nascent antivirus community) managed to get the attention of the media in advance, there were a great many significant infections that were cleaned off in time, before the trigger date.  I recall notices of thousands of machines cleaned off in various institutions.  But, in a sense, we were victims of our own success.  Having got the word out in advance, by the trigger date most of the infections had been cleaned up.  So, yes, the media saw it as hype on our part.  And then there was the fact that a lot of people had no idea when they got hit.  I was told, by several people, &#8220;no, we didn&#8217;t get Michelangelo.  But, you know, it&#8217;s strange: our computer had a disk failure on that date &#8230;&#8221;  That was how Michelangelo appeared, when it triggered.</p>
<p>I note that one of the comments wished that we could find out who created the virus.  There is strong evidence that it was created in Taiwan.  And, in response to a posting that I did at the time, I received a message from someone, from Taiwan, who complained that it shouldn&#8217;t be called &#8220;Michelangelo,&#8221; since the <em><strong>real</strong></em> name was &#8220;Stoned 3.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve always felt that only the person who wrote that variant would have been that upset about the naming &#8230;</p>

				<p>No, I didn&#8217;t get hit.  Someone even older than I am (although he&#8217;s got fewer grandchildren) almost got hit.  Twice.</p>
<p>This is not a stupid guy.  He still runs his own investment company.  A few years ago he recounted a weird call that he thought came from one of his grandkids-in-law.  Everybody who heard the story recognized it for what it was, particularly when it was determined that the grandkid-in-law in question, who does travel a lot, had never made the call.  The scam was explained to the call recipient.</p>
<p>Well, today he sent his whole family into an uproar.  He&#8217;d got another call, and seems to have been one phone call away from wiring off $2500.  Fortunately, a couple of family members determined what was happening, in time, and explained the situation.  Again.</p>
<p>Let me try to explain a bit how this works.</p>
<p>The recipient gets a phone call.</p>
<p>Recipient: [answers phone] Hello?<br />
Caller: Grandpa?<br />
Recipient: Is that you, Mary?</p>
<p>OK, at this point the caller knows that whoever answered the phone has a grandchild named &#8220;Mary.&#8221;  Allow me to theorize why this is the grandparent scam.  Many (older) people may have more grandchildren than they have children, so the odds of hitting someone with a grandchild of the same gender as the caller increase.  Also, most people don&#8217;t know their grandchildren, and the doings of said grandchildren, as well as that of their kids.</p>
<p>The fraudsters who make these calls may do it at random, or they may have bought calling lists of those with interests, demographic information, or medication purchasing patterns indicating that they are older.  These calls may also be targeted at geographic areas with a higher proportion of retired people.</p>
<p>Caller: Yeah.<br />
Recipient: Gee, your voice sounds different/that doesn&#8217;t sound like you.<br />
Caller: I&#8217;m not feeling well/have a cold.</p>
<p>This answer serves two purposes: it explains the differences in voice (although it might not explain an Asian, Russian, or south Asian accent), and also calls on the sympathy of the recipient.</p>
<p>R: That&#8217;s too bad.<br />
C: Yeah.  Actually grandpa, [caller launches into story of woe, ending with a requirement for funds for a) medical services, b) legal fees or bail, c) documentation expenses, d) travel expenses, e) etc.]</p>
<p>This particular call added a few refinements.  The explanation ended with a plea that this situation was all very embarrassing, and so would grandpa please not let anyone know.  Grandpa apparently complied with this request: grandpa did do some checking with the family to try and find the grandchild, and, coyly, wouldn&#8217;t tell what was going on.  It wasn&#8217;t until a) a few family members had had frustrating attempts to find out what the calls were about, and b) the grandchild had been found (well, but busy with an event for one of the great-grandchildren) that the whole story came out.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a second refinement.  In an attempt to add verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative, the caller had finished with the statement that a lawyer would be calling to make arrangements for the money transfer.  Lawyers are trustworthy, of course (no laughing down there in the cheap seats), and the fact that you can no more authenticate the person who claims to be a lawyer than the person who claims to be your grandchild is probably lost on most people.</p>
<p>I say &#8220;fortunately,&#8221; because the calls grandpa made to the family probably blocked the second call, at least for a while.  It is quite possible that the scammer or scammers, hitting a busy signal a couple of times, suspected that calls were being made to family, and cut their losses rather than carry on with a now likely compromised scam.</p>
<p>This is not a new scam.  It&#8217;s a variation on 419s, which were, themselves, variations on the postal mail based &#8220;Nigerian&#8221; scam, which was a variation on the &#8220;Spanish prisoner&#8221; scam going back to the middle ages (which was probably based on a similar and even older scam).  But the scam is widespread, targets generosity rather than greed, and seems to be somewhat resistant to eradication.</p>
<p>Please raise this issue with, and explain it to, older friends and relatives.  The media reports on the scam tend to be minimal, and don&#8217;t explain how easy, and likely, it is to give away information in what you think is normal conversation.</p>
<p>Oh, and just to conclude, when you answer the phone and someone says &#8220;Grandpa?&#8221; or &#8220;Grandma?&#8221;, the correct answer is, &#8220;Who&#8217;s speaking, please?&#8221;</p>

				<p>I first saw this, appropriately enough, on <a href="http://www.improbable.com/2012/03/02/mechanical-high-security-on-paper-the-paper-safe/" target="_blank">Improbable Research</a>.  It&#8217;s appropriate, because, when you see it, first it makes you laugh.  Then it makes you think.</p>
<p>This guy has created a <a href="http://www.robives.com/blog/papersafe" target="_blank">paper safe</a>.  Yeah, you got that right.  A safe, made out of paper.  No, not special paper: plain, ordinary paper, the kind you have in your recycling bin.  He&#8217;s even posted a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=6vsr8pmyrLg" target="_blank">video on YouTube</a> showing how it works.</p>
<p>Right, so everyone&#8217;s going to have a good laugh, yes?  Paper isn&#8217;t going to provide any protection, right?  It&#8217;s a useless oddity, of interest only to those with an interest in origami, and more free time on their hands than any security professional is likely to get.</p>
<p>Except, then you start thinking about it (if you are any kind of security pro.)  First off, it&#8217;s a nice illustration of at least one form of combination lock.  And then you realize that the lock is going to be useless unless it&#8217;s obscured.  So that brings up the topic of maybe security-by-obscurity does have a function sometimes.</p>
<p>Then you start thinking that maybe it isn&#8217;t great as a preventive control, but it sure works as a detective control.  Yeah, it&#8217;s easy to smash and get out whatever was in there.  But it&#8217;ll sure be obvious if you do.</p>
<p>So that brings up different types of controls, and the reasons you might want different controls in different situations, and whether some perfectly adequate controls may be a) overkill, or b) useless under certain conditions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just a cute toy.  It&#8217;s pretty educational, too.  No, I&#8217;m not going to keep my money in it.  But it makes you think &#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>New &#8220;Man in the Browser&#8221; Attack Bypasses Banks’ Two-Factor Authentication Systems</p></blockquote>
<p>Except there is nothing new about this attack. OWASP <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Man-in-the-browser_attack">documented</a> it in 2007 and it was widely known that malware writers used it to bypass 2-factor authentication.</p>
<p>More from Gizmodo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since this attack has shown that the two-factor system is no longer a viable defense, the banking industry may have to adopt more advanced fraud-detection methods</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that this has been going on for more than 5 years, it&#8217;s obvious that banks already have adopted more advanced fraud detection methods.</p>
<p>So why are they forcing you to carry around tokens and one-time passwords that make it awkward and uncomfortable to use your own money as you wish?</p>
<p>Because with only few exceptions, banks&#8217; security guys are not interested in making your life comfortable. The more you suffer, the more you think they are secure.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s time to ask for accountability? Which of their so-called security features is really for security, and which is for CYA or &#8216;make-the-regulator-happy&#8217;?</p>

				<p>C. S. Lewis wrote some pretty good sci-fi, some excellent kids books (which <a href="http://nvdpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/540870032_the_chronicles_of_narnia">Disney managed to ruin</a>), and my favourite <a href="http://playspirituality.wordpress.com/2006/12/18/exmuss-and-crismass-by-cs-lewis/">satire on the commercialization of Christmas</a>.  Most people, though, would know him as a writer on Christianity.  So I wonder if Stephen Harper and Vic Toews have ever read him.  One of the things he wrote was, &#8220;It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/292611-bill-c-30.html">Bill C-30</a> (sometimes known as the Investigating and Preventing Criminal Electronic Communications Act, sometimes known as the Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act, and sometimes just known as &#8220;the online spy bill&#8221;) is heading for Committee of the Whole.  This means that some aspects of it may change.  But it&#8217;ll have to change an awful lot before it becomes even remotely acceptable.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got interesting provisions.  Apparently, as it stands, it doesn&#8217;t allow law enforcement to actually demand access to information without a warrant.  But it allows the to request a &#8220;voluntary&#8221; disclosure of information.  Up until, law enforcement could request voluntary disclosure, of course.  But then the ISP would refuse pretty much automatically, since to provide that information would breach PIPEDA.  So now that automatic protection seems to be lost.</p>
<p>(Speaking of PIPEDA, there is <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/02/20/bc-trackingdevice.html">this guy who is being tracked by who-knows-who</a>.  The tracking is being done by an American company, so they can&#8217;t be forced by Canadian authorities to say who planted the bug.  But the data is being passed by a Canadian company, Kore Wireless.  And, one would think, they are in breach of PIPEDA, since they are passing personal information to a jurisdiction [the United States] which basically has no legal privacy protection at all.)</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be law enforcement, either.  The Minister would have the right to authorize anyone his (or her) little heart desires to request the information.</p>
<p>Then there is good old <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/michael-geist/bill-c-30_b_1293622.html">Section 14</a>, which allows the government to make ISPs install any kind of surveillance equipment the government wants, impose confidentiality on anything (like telling people they are being surveilled), or impose any other operational requirements they want.</p>
<p>Now, our Minister of Public Safety (doesn&#8217;t that name just make you feel all warm and 1984ish?), Vic Toews, has been promoting the heck out of the bill, even though he actually <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/02/18/pol-thehouse-vic-toews.html">doesn&#8217;t know what it says or what&#8217;s in it</a>.  He does know that if you oppose C-30 you are on the side of child pornographers.  This has led a large number of Canadians to cry out <a href="#!/search/%23donttoewsmebro">#DontToewsMeBro</a> and to suggest that it might be best to <a href="#!/search/%23tellviceverything">#TellVicEverything</a>.  <a href="http://www.rickmercer.com/">Rick Mercer</a>, Canada&#8217;s answer to Jon Stewart and famous for his &#8220;rants,&#8221; has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_3q_9_OC-o">weighed in on the matter</a>.</p>
<p>As far as Toews and friends are concerned, the information that they are after, your IP address and connections, are just like a phone book.  Right.  Well, a few years back Google made their &#8220;phone book&#8221; available.  Given the huge volume of information, even though it was anonymized, researchers were able to aggregate information, and determine locations, names, interests, political views, you name it.  Hey, Google themselves admit that <a href="http://www.google.org/flutrends/about/how.html">they can tell how you&#8217;re feeling</a>.</p>
<p>But, hey, maybe I&#8217;m biased.  Ask a lawyer.  <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/">Michael Geist</a> knows about these things, and he&#8217;s concerned.  (Check out his notes on the new copyright bill, too.</p>
<p>The thing is, it&#8217;s not going to do what the government says it&#8217;s going to do.  This will not automatically stop child pornography, or terrorism, or online fraudsters.  Hard working, diligent law enforcement officers are going to do that.  There are a lot of those diligent law enforcement officers out there, and they are doing a sometimes amazing job.  And I&#8217;d like to help.  But providing this sort of unfiltered data dump for them isn&#8217;t going to help.  It&#8217;s going to hurt.  The really diligent ones are going to be crowded out by lazy yahoos who will want to waltz into ISP offices and demand data.  And then won&#8217;t be able to understand it.</p>
<p>How do I know this?  It&#8217;s simple.  Anyone who knows about the technology can tell you that this kind of access is 1) an invasion of privacy, and 2) not going to help.  But this government is going after it anyway.  In spite of the fact that the Minister responsible doesn&#8217;t know what is in the bill.  (Or so he says.)  Why is that?  Is it because they are wilfully evil?  (Oh, the temptation.)  Well, no.  These situations tend to be governed by Hanlon&#8217;s Rzor which, somewhat modified, states that you should never attribute to malicious intent, that which can adequately explained by assuming pure, blind, pig-ignorant stupidity.</p>
<p>QED.</p>
