			<p>I suggest you tell your browsers to change how it handles .pdf files so that instead of displaying them in your browser it will download them. Sven Vetsch has written about a flaw found by found by Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon in which a <a href="http://www.disenchant.ch/blog/hacking-with-browser-plugins/34">.pdf file can run arbitrary JavaScript</a> on the site hosting the file. It seems that just host hosting PDFs you are putting your sites users at risk to all the evil doings JavaScript can perform. If you want to find out more about the flaw I suggest you read the afore-linked blog post, or <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/danger-danger-danger/">gnucitizen&#8217;s take on it</a> (which has a PoC on it). What I am more interested in right now is fixing the issue.</p>
<p>Obviously a plugin upgrade would be nice, but what about between then and now? I&#8217;d be happy if we could get a fix out quickly for web masters to apply to their sites but since the part of the url after the hash is never sent the server (which in this case is what holds the malicous code) any server side solution is pretty much impossible.<br />
Oh what a fun start to the new year eh? On a more light hearted note, first person to see a SPAM email using this technique wins a virtual cookie from me.

			<p>(in keeping with my &#8216;purging&#8217; theme, I&#8217;m gonna release old blog posts that I meant to come back and clean up.  These are just scattered remnants of long-gone ideas&#8230;)</p>
<p>A few years back, I worked for this company that subjected all their employees to &#8216;out-of-the-box&#8217; training.   It was a non-grueling, week-long seminar that was mandatory for all IT disciplines and included team-building exercises, personality inventories, group puzzles, creative-thinking exercises, etc.  At the end of the week, we were supposed to be equipped to solve problems in creative ways.  It was very lame.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Security groups were way out of the box.  In fact, most didn&#8217;t even acknowledge the existence of a box.  Over the years, they have not only invented the box - they have reverse-houdinied themselves into the box.  How did that happen?</p>
<p>1) Security has become increasingly complex.</p>
<p>2) The single human brain can only master a finite amount of information.</p>
<p>3) Niche skills become the norm.</p>
<p>Add all this up and you get what I call &#8220;The problem of Babel&#8221;.  We are creating (have created) a growth-limiting caste system.  Instead of building a large Tower which would enhance our view of the landscape and feed our creativity,  we have dotted the landscape with disjoint  chimneys.  The chimney&#8217;s rarely touch, have no solid base for high growth, are limited in size and scope, and end up trapping those inside.</p>
<p>And, <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/230">one more</a></p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>!Dmitry

			<p>Happy New Year!  It&#8217;s 2007 and one of my goals is to do less work and spend more time with my family.  I think we all have things on our &#8216;TODO&#8217; list that, at some point, we have to acknowledge we will never get around to.  I keep a folder of interesting snippets that I always intended to come back to.  In reviewing my &#8217;snippet&#8217; list, I see things from 2001 and 2002 that I&#8217;m not even close to getting around to.  I see applications that I downloaded in 1999 or 2000 that I never got around to breaking or even installing.  And, worse, I&#8217;ve got other snippets that have been deposited that take precedence over these older snippets.  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/JeremiahGrossman">Jeremiah Grossman</a> blogged about something similar on his blog.  To cut to the chase, I have some silt from the bottom of my TODO pool that is muddying the water of my brain&#8230;I&#8217;d like to give it to you.  Maybe you&#8217;ll find some gold.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if you could do a pen-test of a company and have the ability to root their internal machines?  I&#8217;m talking about the machines that reside inside the network - behind all the DMZes, proxies, firewalls, policy routers, etc.  A nice juicy machine sitting in the ripe delta of a virgin network.  It&#8217;s do-able, but it&#8217;ll take a little work.  Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>1) How many companies run hardened SMTP servers on the edge of their network.  These machines are usually anti-virus scanners and have been fuzzed to death.  They are hard to break into.  However, if they forward email to an internal (juicy) server which is the same server which handles bounces&#8230;well, then now we have a situation where we can coerce an internal server into connecting to us.  At the least, we get a connect from their outbound SMTP relay which is often a different machine than their hardened primary MX servers.</p>
<p>2) similar idea for DNS servers.  Your scanner typically won&#8217;t be able to exploit (or even see) the companies recursive DNS servers.  But, if we can find some service which resolves an IP to a FQDN or vice versa (&#8221;HELO x.x.x.x&#8221;), then all we need to do is connect to that service from an IP range where we control the DNS.  Now, we have their DNS server connecting to us.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this presupposes that you have already reverse-fuzzed the juicy applications in your lab and have a nice exploit for them.  The last time I checked, these sort of exploits weren&#8217;t hard to come by.  The same application that verifies byte-size, order of each byte, regex, etc. of each line of *inbound* SMTP header will happily recv() and process 4097 malicious bytes of a 220 banner when initiating an outbound SMTP connection.  I wish I could go on this hunt, but I don&#8217;t have the time, resources, or otherwise.  May the heads of Exchange, Novell, and Lotus decorate your hunting lodge.</p>
<p>3) Years ago, I wrote a program that automated a lot of fingerprinting of a target domain.  Here is what the help screen looked like:</p>
<p>[root@tekakwitha root]# ./footprinter -h</p>
<p>Usage:  ./footprinter -C &#8220;FULL_COMPANY NAME&#8221; -D &#8220;domain.{net,com,edu},domain2&#8243; [-W Whois.server]<br />
-C :  Company name.  Can be multiples, ie -C &#8220;Company 1,Company 2,Company 3&#8243;, etc&#8230;<br />
-D :  Domain(s).  Can be multiples, ie -D &#8220;sony.com,google.com,philly.com&#8221;, etc&#8230;<br />
-h :  This message<br />
-c :  Crawl www.sec.gov EDGAR DB looking for &#8220;subsidiary&#8221; regexp<br />
-H :  Search for DNS HST records and query for domain authority (if company maintains DNS)<br />
-W :  Specify a different whois server (default is whois.arin.net)</p>
<p>I never got the program debugged (or even working right).  It would be cool to have a program that would find company dependencies, other companies registered by the same email addr as our target domain, other domain servers for subsidiary domains, other mail servers for linked domains, remote sites which pay for a DSL connection but registered it with the parent companies domain name or email addr&#8230;etc.  When I worked for a large Fortune 500 company, I found many remote sites which were connected to the Corporate belly via a 56k line.  Since they didn&#8217;t want 500 employees hitting the web via their 56k link which also carried business data, they paid for their own DSL link to the Internet.  Of course, rooting the DSL router was akin to gaining full access to the internal Corporate network.</p>
<p>4) on a similar note, finding devices on a network which are NAT-ing traffic is an interesting exercise.  This list would include proxies, wireless APs, cable/DSL routers, firewalls, etc.  If I&#8217;m working for a large Corp, I want to know where my dual-homed hosts reside.</p>
<p>5) I want my vulnerability scanner to tell me if any of the IPs within my scan range have been used recently in any sort of spam relaying.  That&#8217;s an easy one.</p>
<p>6) I want my application scanner to go through google&#8217;s cache, wayback machine, etc and tell me links and apps that used to exist but are no longer spider-able (but, might still exist), parameters that used to be passed to apps, etc.  That&#8217;s useful information and I would add it into my spidered data as if the data *was* there (because it often is).</p>
<p>7) I want my application scanner to detect browser-side parsing and then tell me where the same parsing is not being done on the server side.  In fact, I have a long wishlist for application scanners.  I&#8217;ll just stop here.  In general, *Intelligence* is missing from application scanners.  That&#8217;s why I end up doing stuff by hand (trap-modify-send-repeat) and why I have started hating application scans&#8230;</p>
<p>8) I want my fuzzer to be able to speak (in real time) with the process of the app that I&#8217;m fuzzing.  I think Jared from MSU might be doing something like this in the future&#8230;so, I&#8217;ll just wait for this one <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>9) I want to know why bearshare webserver filters out 11 characters (left as an exercise to the reader&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to have to look up the HTML codes to get them printed on the blog) and any byte above 0&#215;80 in the *initial* request but then allows it for all subsequent requests.</p>
<p>10) On Microsoft RPC on 135, why does fiddling with the &#8220;DCE Maximum Entries&#8221; field often cause crashes or memory issues?</p>
<p>11) Why would a company store a web log called logs.txt in the web root and store passwords within the log in a simple XOR?</p>
<p>12) Why is it so easy to knock over h.323 devices?  Or, in general, most VoIP protocols.  Wasn&#8217;t there gonna be some company that wrote a voip fuzzer and then tested all these devices, sending the results off to CERT or some other body for dispersal?</p>
<p>Well, again, Happy New Year.  I already feel lighter and strangely rejuvinated <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p><em>Update 30th Dec:</em> Added information about Downloader-ARL, Troj/Dloadr-ANE and TROJ_TIBS.PE<br />
<em>Update #2:</em> Added W32.Mixor.Q@mm hyperlink and information about Trojan.Galapoper.A<br />
<em>Update 31th Dec:</em> New variants are out and the AV coverage is remarkable poor. The new variants use several different subject lines and attachments Greeting Card.exe or Greeting Postcard.exe<br />

			<p>Today was day 0 of CCC (<span style="text-align: center"><a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2006/">Chaos Communication Congress</a>, in Berlin), meaning, although there weren&#8217;t any lectures and although there were only a few dozens to a few hundreds of visitors at any given time - it was still fun!</span></p>
<p>Early in the day (around 15:30) I went to the conference center expecting to pick Raven and go for food. I expected it to be empty, boy, was I wrong. There were at the very least 5 folks outside in the cold, and at least 10 folks (more, but I saw 10) inside the center itself. Mostly just staff.</p>
<p>After meeting up with Raven and registering with the conference (greets Maha), we went for some dinner. I just got some french fries (I&#8217;m sure you wanted to know that). When we got back there was already a 200 meters line for the registration booth (not that it was open) and dozens of people in all the chill-out areas. We walked around the building and met up with some cool people (greets Andy, Jake, Fukami and many others).</p>
<p>Things really kicked up when we discovered the <a class="l" onmousedown="return rwt(this,'','','res','2','__CdxbrKrvMdaV4NH0UJ0VhGU5L4Q=','&#038;sig2=4aUBckKsYFACsrP7dp54JA')" href="http://www.phenoelit.de/">Phenoelit</a> hang-out below-decks and got beered up by FX, Mumpi and the rest of this cool group. Later on, Kaminsky showed up&#8230; got jumped (literally) by FX and yours truly, and the rest is history. There have also been some surprises, such as a very cool LED flashlight I got from a very cool guy who ended up being John Gilmore of GDB/EFF/etc. fame.</p>
<p>I had to leave at around 1 AM to catch up on some work before the big first day tomorrow (now today), but on the way I met up with Ilja (of fuzzing fame) and one cool yet poor fellah whose laptop&#8217;s BIOS was wiped clean at midnight (and he lectures 8 AM sharp)&#8230; the list of folks goes on and on.</p>
<p>Germans really know how to have fun, and drink. CCC is definitely going to be interesting in its 23rd year, and it is worth it both from the technical side (talks) and the networking side. The first day is coming up, and one thing is for sure, there&#8217;s going to be a lot of beer (althogh this &#8220;official CCC drink - Mate - really grows on me!)</p>
<p>Note to self: study German. Note to defcon: get CCC style on-site food.</p>
<p>Note to world: bad black jokes are allowed in Germany, with younger crowds, anyway.<br />

			<p>I love Google&#8217;s web applications. They are cool and actually set a new standard for the Web we know today. It&#8217;s fun and educating to check out their JavaScript code. And as usual, when you dig into somebody&#8217;s code, you find surprises.  <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/772#more-772">Continue reading Google debug&#8230;</a>

			<p>Hey, do I smell history repeating itself? Bots on IRC used to be useful too, and then used for local flooding. Only later did they become the botnets that they are today. <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So, from automated playing when you are not around to keep stuff active (rings a bell?) to botnets that throw&#8230; privates at people. <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>Worth a read. I always love when the real world and the virtual meet, whether by marriages or by physical world Police taking complaints because &#8220;someone stole my weapon on World of Worldcraft!!&#8221;</p>

			<p>In this post ( <a href="http://www.phenoelit.net/lablog/Irresponsible.sl">http://www.phenoelit.net/lablog/Irresponsible.sl</a> ), FX describes a drop zone for a phishing/banking trojan horse, and how he got to it.</p>
<p>Go FX. I will refrain from commenting on the report he describes from secure science, which I guess is a comment on its own.</p>
<p>We had the same thing happen twice before in 2006 (that is worth mentioning or can be, in public).</p>
<p>Once with a very large &#8220;security intelligence&#8221; company giving drop zone data in a marketing attempt to get more bank clients (&#8221;hey buddy, why are 400 banks surfing to our drop zone?!?!)</p>
<p>Twice with a guy at defcon showing a live drop zone, and the data analysis for it, asking for it to be taken down (it wasn&#8217;t until a week later during the same lecture at the first ISOI workshop hosted by Cisco). For this guy&#8217;s defense though, he was sharing information. In a time where nearly no one was aware of drop zones even though they have been happening for years, he shared data which was valuable commercially, openly, and allowed others to clue up on the threats.</p>
<p>Did anyone ever consider this is an intelligence source, and take down not being exactly the smartest move?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough that the good guys all fight over the same information, and even the most experienced security professionals make mistakes that cost in millions of USD daily, but publishing drop zone IPs publicly? That can only result in a lost intelligence source and the next one being, say, not so available.</p>
<p>I believe in public information and the harm of over-secrecy, I am however a very strong believer that some things are secrets for a reason. What can we expect though, when the security industry is 3 years behind and we in the industry are all a bunch of self-taught amateurs having fun with our latest discoveries.</p>
<p>At least we have responsible folks like FX around to take care of things when others screw up.</p>
<p>I got tired of being the bad guy calling &#8220;the king is naked&#8221;, at least in this case we can blame FX. <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>It&#8217;s an intelligence war people, and it is high time we got our act together.</p>
<p>I will raise this subject at the next ISOI workshop hosted by Microsoft<br />
( <a href="http://isotf.org/isoi2.html">http://isotf.org/isoi2.html</a> ) and see what bright ideas we come up with.</p>

			<p>A few months back I released a post on where I think <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/697">anti-botnets technology is heading</a>. Now it&#8217;s time for what happened in 2006, and what we can expect from here on.</p>
<p>I am not a believer in such retrospective looks, as often, they are completely biased and based on what we have seen and what we want to see. This is why I will try and limit myself to what we know happens and is likely to get attention, as well as what we have seen tried by bad guys, which is working for them enough to take to the next level.</p>
<p>What changed with botnets in 2006:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>1.</b>Botnets reached a level where it is unclear today what parts of the Internet are not compromised to an extent. Count by clean rather than infected.<br />
<b>2.</b> Botnets have become the most significant platform from which virtually any type of online attack and crime are launched. Botnets equal an online infrastructure for abusive or criminal activity online.<br />
<b>3.</b> In the past year, botnets have become mainstream. From a not existent field even in the professional realm up to a few years ago, where attacks were happening constantly reagrdless, it has turned to the main buzzword and occupation of the security industry today, directly and indirectly.<br />
<b>4.</b> Websites have returned to being one the most significant form of infection for building botnets, which hadn&#8217;t been the case since the late 90s.<br />
<b>5.</b> Botnets have become the moving force behind organized crime online, with a low-risk high-profit calculation.<br />
<b>6.</b> New technologies are finally being introduced, moving the botnet controllers from using just (or mainly) IRC to more advanced C&#038;C (command and control) channels such as P2P, or multi-layered, such as DNS and IRC on the OSI model.<br />
<b>7.</b> Botnets used to be a game of quantity. Today, when quantity is assured, quality is becoming a high concern for botnet controllers, both in type of bot as well as in abilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s going to happen with botnets in 2007:</p>
<blockquote><p>Botnets won&#8217;t change. All will remain the same as it has been for years. Awareness however, will increase making the problem appear larger and larger, perhaps approaching its real scale. The bad guys would utilize their infrastructure to get more out of the bots (quality once quantity is here) and be able to do more than just steal cash. Maximizing their revenue.</p>
<p>Further, more and more attackers unrelated to the botnet controllers will make use of already compromised systems and existing botnets to gain access to networks, to facilitate anything from corporate espionage and intelligence gathering, to shame-less and open show of strength to those who oppose them (think Blue Security), in the real world as well as the cyber one (which to the mob is one and the same, it&#8217;s the income that speaks).</p>
<p>Meaning, the existing botnets infrastructure will be utilized both in an open fashion, due to the fact online miscreants (real-world mob) face virtually no risk, as well as quiet and secretive uses for third-party intelligence operations.</p></blockquote>

			<p>When we talk about security awareness, we sometimes say that a certain company &#8220;does not get it&#8221;. It&#8217;s hard to define how we measure that and what makes us say that a certain company does or does not &#8220;get it&#8221; (or even what &#8220;it&#8221; is) - we just know, just like you can tell which mp3 players suck or which jokes are funny but you can&#8217;t always say why.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Many security experts will agree that companies that &#8220;don&#8217;t get it&#8221; fail time after time in trivial security matters, whereas companies with high security awareness will only rarely screw up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The Bank of America was on my list of companies who &#8216;got&#8217; what security really is. From the first time I signed up to the service, I noticed they did not fall into the <a title="Security by Obstruction" href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/553">Security by Obstruction</a> trap. Signing up was easy, I got to select my own username and password which means I didn&#8217;t need to write either one down (finally an online bank that understands brute force attacks should be blocked at the server side and not by forcing the client to choose an impossible password). In fact, it&#8217;s the only password or PIN that I don&#8217;t have 3-4 copies of in all my electronic and physical wallets.</p>
