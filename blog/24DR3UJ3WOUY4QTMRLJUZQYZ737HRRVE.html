				<p>Today was the third day when the Web site of Finnish broadcasting company YLE (Yleisradio) suffer problems of large-scale DDoS attack.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.yle.fi/news/id60378.html">YLE News site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The company&#8217;s web pages were targeted by of a concerted attack on Monday and Tuesday. Two other major web sites, those of the telecommunications service provider Eniro, and the Suomi24 portal also reported similar attack.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There are several possible motives - <a href="http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Widespread+DoS+attacks+paralyse+public+broadcasters+website+/1135227309709">Finland was the host</a> of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2007">Eurovision Song Contest 2007</a> last weekend and our <a href="http://www.yle.fi/news/id60134.html">second place in hockey World Championship</a> during the next day.</p>
<p>Some people said earlier that there was <a href="http://www.yle.fi/news/id60339.html">connections</a> to recent DoS attacks on Estonian government sites too.</p>

				<p>I didn&#8217;t read Schneier&#8217;s Wired article (http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/04/securitymatters_0419) until it came out in his newsletter, but it struck an immediate chord.  He was commenting on Akerlof&#8217;s work proving that, when vendors know a lot more than buyers, the marketplace ends up flooded with bad &#8220;goods.&#8221;  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons)  (He doesn&#8217;t mention Gresham, who showed that items of inherent value tend to disappear from the market (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_Law).)</p>
<p>As a reviewer of security books, I see this all the time.  It takes time to write a book.  It also takes time to learn something of value to put into a book.  So it&#8217;s a lot easier to write a bunch of nonsense and sell it.  After all, almost by definition, the people to whom you are selling the books will not know the difference.  If they could tell the difference between good advice and bad advice, they wouldn&#8217;t need any advice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also seeing the same thing in conferences.  Conferences are expensive to organize.  And, increasingly, conferences are organized by professional event companies, not anyone who really knows or cares about the topic.  Therefore, it is easier and cheaper to get vendor representatives as speakers for the events.  (Generally the vendors are only too happy to send their people, and will pay all the expenses, <strong>and</strong> sponsor something for the conference as well.)  People who actually know something probably don&#8217;t want to pay their own way to speak at these things (or can&#8217;t), or can&#8217;t be bothered to jump through the hoops held out by the event companies.

<p>He is right, but I have a comment I felt it was important - to me - to make. Not just on this particular vulnerability, but on the &#8220;war&#8221;.</p>
<p>I must admit, vulnerabilities are endless and new exploitation vectors will never end, even if it was possible and we were all 100% secure, someone (an attacker rather than a vulnerability) will find a way to make it 99% again for the right investment or with the right moment of brilliance.</p>
<p>Enough with cheap philosophy though&#8230; as tired (even exhausted) as I am of the endless repeating circle which security is, on all levels (from the people involved through the interests involved all the way to the same-old-FUD) I still haven&#8217;t burned out, and I am still here.</p>
<p>The world isn&#8217;t going to end tomorrow, and even if the Internet was to die (which I doubt it will), we will survive. However, in the recent couple of years a new community has been forming which we started refering to as &#8220;Internet security operations&#8221;. These folks, for various motives, work to make the Internet stay up and become safer (actually being safe is a long lost battle we should have never fought the way things were built).</p>
<p>With such a community being around, treating issues beyond our little corner of the `net is possible to a level, and at least some progress is made. Some anti virus engineers no longer care only about samples, some network engineers no longer care only about their networks, etc.</p>
<p>Is any of this a solution? No. The problems themselves will not go away, they aren&#8217;t in any significant fashion currently being dealt with beyond the tactical level of a fire brigade.</p>
<p>Is it the end than? Of course not. But operations vs. research are determined by intelligence. As we have some intelligence, I can point to yet another annoying vulnerability in the endless circle which those of us who will want to, can study, and if they feel it is justified, defend<br />
against. That is the broadband routers issue, which personally I&#8217;d really rather avoid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this limited defense is what most of us can do at our own homes, or tops as a volunteer fire brigade or neighborhood watch.</p>
<p>The Internet is the most disconnected global village I can imagine, but we all have the funny uncle on another network and a weird one on yet another. I sometimes feel that the old analogy of the Internet to the Wild West is not quite it. Perhaps we are living in the Wild West, only if instead of wastelands and small towns, we have New York city and the laws<br />
of a feudal dark ages Kingdom.</p>
<p>Things will eventually change, and some of us will stick around to help that change (or try to). For now though, it is about one vulnerability ignored at a time, and working on our communities.</p>

				<p>In this post I&#8217;d like to discuss the threat widely circulated insecure broadband routers pose today. We have touched on it before.</p>
<p>Today, yet another public report of a vulnerable DSL modem type was posted to bugtraq, this time about a potential WIRELESS flaw with broadband routers being insecure at Deutsche Telekom. I haven&#8217;t verified this one myself but it refers to &#8220;Deutsche Telekom Speedport w700v broadband router&#8221;:<br />
<a href="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2007/May/0178.html">http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2007/May/0178.html</a></p>
<p>If you all remember, there was another report a few months ago about a UK ISP named BeThere with their wireless router being accessible from the Internet and exploitable, as another example:<br />
<a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/826">http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/826</a></p>
<p>Two issues here:<br />
1. Illegitimate access to broadband routers via wireless communication.<br />
2. Illegitimate access to broadband routers via the WAN.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to discuss #2.</p>
<p>Some ISPs which provide such devices (as in the example of #2 above) use them as bridges only, preventing several attack vectors (although not all). Many others don&#8217;t. Most broadband ISPs have a vulnerable user-base on some level.</p>
<p>Many broadband ISPs around the world distribute such devices to their clients.</p>
<p>Although the general risk is well known, like with many other security issues many of us remained mostly quiet in the hope of avoiding massive exploitation. As usual, we only delayed the inevitable. I fear that the lack of awareness among some ISPs for this &#8220;not yet widely exploited threat&#8221; has resulted in us not being PROACTIVE and taking action to secure the Internet in this regard. What else is new, we are all busy with yesterday&#8217;s fires to worry about tomorrow&#8217;s.<br />
Good people will REACT and solve the problem when it pops up in wide-exploitation, but what we may potentially be facing is yet another vector for massive infections and the creation of eventual bot armies on yet another platform.</p>
<p>My opinion is, that with all these public disclosures and a ripe pool of potential victims, us delaying massive exploitation of this threat may not last. I believe there is currently a window of opportunity for service providers to act and secure their user-base without rushing. Nothing in security is ever perfect, but actions such as changing default passwords and preventing connections from the WAN to these devices would be a good step to consider if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to take a look at your infrastructure and what your users use, and if you haven&#8217;t already, add some security there. You probably have a remote login option for your tech support staff which you may want to explore - and secure. That&#8217;s if things were not left at their defaults.</p>
<p>Then, I&#8217;d also suggest scanning your network for what types of broadband routers your users make use of, and how many of your clients have port 23 or 80 open. Whether you provide with the devices or not, many will be using different ones set to default which may pose a similar threat. Being aware of the current map of vulnerable devices of this type in your networks can&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p>It is not often that we can predict which of the numerous threats out there that we do not address currently, is going to become exploited next. If you can spare the effort, I&#8217;d strongly urge you to explore this front and be proactive on your own networks.</p>
<p>The previous unaddressed threat which most of us chose to ignore was spoofing. We all knew of it for a very long time, but some of us believed it did not pose a threat to the Internet or their networks for no other reason than &#8220;it is not currently being exploited&#8221; and &#8220;there are enough bots out there for spoofing to not be necessary&#8221;. I still remember the bitter argument I had with Randy Bush over that one. This is a rare opportunity, let&#8217;s not waste it.</p>
<p>We are all busy, but I hope some of you will have the time to look into this.</p>
<p>I am aware of and have assisted several ISPs, who spent some time and effort exploring this threat and in some cases acting on it. If anyone can share their experience on dealing with securing their infrastructure in this regard publicly, it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

				<p>From USA Today <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-05-07-tsa-probe_N.htm">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;If that information is out there, it&#8217;s very easy to find out who they are,&#8221; said <strong>John Adler</strong>, executive vice president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, whose members include air marshals. Adler said terrorists could use personnel information to find where air marshals live, photograph them and disseminate the photos.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is really serious now.</p>
<p>The subject could be &#8220;I’m Federal Air Marshal and I bought my identity from TSA’s HD&#8221; as well.

				<p>After being <a href="http://www.whitestar.linuxbox.org/pipermail/fuzzing/2007-March/000337.html">challenged by Gadi</a>, we decided to make the beSTORM .ANI file fuzzing module description available publicly.</p>
<p>This module is interesting because Microsoft&#8217;s fuzzing team, using a template-based fuzzing module, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sdl/archive/2007/04/26/lessons-learned-from-the-animated-cursor-security-bug.aspx">missed</a> during their testing a vulnerability that turned out to be a <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/5XP0515L5W.html">zero-day</a>. We built it by simply feeding a few sample files into <a href="http://www.beyondsecurity.com/beSTORM">beSTORM</a> and using its autolearn feature to produce a file fuzzing module. The module we produced does catch the 0-day but we welcome any feedback as to how good or bad this module actually is.</p>
<p>The fuzzing module description is available <a href="http://www.beyondsecurity.com/bestorm_animodule.html">here</a>.

				<p>I figured it is high time for an off-topic post, and it was so off-topic I ended up just moving it to <a href="http://gevron.livejournal.com/">my &#8220;fun blog&#8221;</a> which I haven&#8217;t updated in over a year.</p>
<p>Here it is just for kicks:</p>
<p>A friend recently wrote to the SF-hackers mailing list that she loved Spiderman III. I couldn&#8217;t resist writing how much I disagree with her. (<a href="http://whitestar.linuxbox.org/mailman/listinfo/sf-hackers">SF-hackers</a> is a mailing list for hackers, security dorks, old NANOG and IETF folks, etc. who love science fiction, anime, comics, etc.).</p>
<p>Honestly? I&#8217;d suggest to people to skip it. I love Spiderman. His sarcasm rulez!!!111!!11111111</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t like the movie.</p>
<p>Reasons vary from too much B/S (rambling, crying, crying, rambling, more crying) to comic abuse (as a friend said &#8220;did they really put these two girls together in one film? Might as well have brought in Lois Lane&#8221;).<br />
Did I mention the crying yet?</p>
<p>They were very comic-faithful in other occasions, though, such as the Church bell scene, and there were many scenes only devoted fans probably understood (mostly with old men in them).</p>
<p>Also, what&#8217;s with having 3 bad guys in one movie?!</p>
<p>As to the friendly neighborhood Spiderman jumping on flags, I found it quite cool considering it&#8217;s Spiderman III. Everything after it made me realize just how disgusting Hollywood movies are these days with politics everywhere (even 300 - spit - had a &#8220;for freedom!!&#8221; element).<br />
The movie could only be more ideological if it mentioned Iraq. As a good friend said: &#8220;that&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t make a Captain America movie!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had fun, but as I read in some SF forum: &#8220;you laughed when you were supposed to cry, and cried when you were supposed to laugh&#8221;. Another comment there was &#8220;I came ready for Auntie May&#8217;s lecture, but this movie was really just too much!&#8221;</p>
<p>All the foreplay, no game. In the same forum I mention above someone suggested just watching the action scenes would be great (about 10 minutes out of the very long movie). I got reminded of a British late-evening (get back from the pub) show not many brits have actually watched - Coupling. Amazing show. Cult for me.</p>
<p>In Coupling, Jeff often watches movies in a very similar fashion (not exact quote):<br />
&#8220;Yeah, the nudity in that movie was amazing!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Jeff, it was just one scene!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Depends how you watch it!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather watch a Coupling re-run, than Spiderman III.</p>
<p>[Important note: not the failed US version of Coupling]</p>
<p>Yes, as bad as it was I did have fun. I contradict myself? That&#8217;s nothing new. I love supporting different view-points, even (or especially) if they are mine. <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
On that note, at defcon 14 (2006) someone spoke with me on how I liked defcon after a prolonged discussion between goons in the speaker room on what they thought, I said &#8220;I&#8217;m having fun&#8221; or something in that playground. Paul Vixie was not convinced and chimed in: &#8220;Don&#8217;t take Gadi&#8217;s viewpoint on these things, his country is currently in war being bombed, and people die over there.&#8221;. I am not sure if he was suggesting I am not in touch with reality or being overly optimistic, but I tend to believe both of these have some merit.<br />
As usual, not an exact quote.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I got out to the trade seminars.  You know, marketing&#8217;s traveling bumpf show, where they trot out the VP of sales, plus a &#8220;security evangelist&#8221; or somebody with some such title (who has a technical background, but likes schmoozing more than doing actual research).  I used to go to lots: it&#8217;s a good way to get up to speed when you first enter a field, but the law of diminishing returns tends to set in real fast in terms of actual information.</p>
<p>There were actually two that I signed up for this week.  SANS had one, and I&#8217;ve never been to any SANS stuff, so I went to that.  Intel also had a real dog and pony show, with extra associated vendors.  When I get home from these things, Gloria always asks me whether I&#8217;m glad I went.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I went to the SANS show.  Didn&#8217;t get much out of the presentation itself.  But the style of the presentation was intriguing: an awful lot of &#8220;cute stuff&#8221; demonstrated, without much actual information being relayed.  The attitude of the presenters was also interesting: they were definitely in it for the cash.<br />

				<p>In a post by Brian Krebs in the <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/04/virus_writers_taint_google_ad.html">Washington post</a>, Brian describes how Virus (malware) makers have started to spend cash on buying sponsored links of high-profile keywords which get regularly visited by poorly patched people so that they can infect them with malwares.</p>
<p>One such high-profile keyword is the <strong>BBB</strong>, the Better Business Bureau, which as you would guess it most average joes would go to visit and will look for, while buying something like <strong>Slashdot </strong>won&#8217;t <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>This of course is an interesting move, though not so much unexpected. I can see an &#8220;legit-company&#8221; coming soon, where a company of such malware distribution will have an R&#038;D - create new malwares and find new vulnerabilities, Marketing - buy high profile keywords, or generally get people interested in your malware infected web site and Sales - sell bot nets and infected/hacked computers for money type of organizations.

				<p>Just a few quick snippets.</p>
<p>First, as mentioned on <a href="http://blog.vulnerableminds.com">vulnerableminds.com</a>, Google has some kick-ass training videos available.  I recommend the following search: <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=type%3Agoogle+engEDU+security">http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=type%3Agoogle+engEDU+security</a></p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;m still trying to break my Motorola Q.  However, the fuzzing is going slow due to a stupid little thing called DHCP!  I have to literally watch the fuzzing as my IP changes so often.  Add to this the fact that I&#8217;m naturally lazy and prone to distraction and you have a recipe for disaster (read: lawsuit).  An interesting post on cell phone (in)security can be found <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/print/expert/article/millionaire/30108">here</a>.</p>
<p>Third, I&#8217;m into source code scanning (well, actually, I&#8217;m into the automation of source code scanning).  I&#8217;ve mentioned Ounce labs in the past&#8230;Well, <a href="http://blogs.owasp.org/diniscruz/">Dinis Cruz</a> was just cajoled into doing some work for them.  I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with Dinis in the past.  This freaking guy is a .NET ninja!  I expect Ounce will be kicking butt in this arena very soon.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, if you&#8217;re a GPF fan there is a very cool movie that Jared Demott put together.  Go see it <a href="http://www.appliedsec.com/files/gpf_demo/gpf_demo.html">here</a></p>

				<p>Being knee deep in online mischief all day I sometimes forget that most of the online attacks are simply extensions of offline ones. The Nigerian scam has been performed via fax and (snail) mail for decades now - I even got a 419 scam by postcard a year back that made me feel very special that someone will waste a stamp on me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Spam is obviously just an online extension of junk mail, only in a different order of magnitude, and same goes for phishing compared to identity theft. But there is one fraud scheme I&#8217;m especially fond of - <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/838">&#8216;pump-n-dump&#8217;</a>, where you get a spam email about a stock that&#8217;s about to go up (&#8221;skyrocket&#8221;), hoping enough people will buy it and make it go up so that the person who initiated the attack can sell quantities of this penny stock and leave the victims with a worthless piece of paper.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The &#8216;pump-n-dump&#8217; is an extension of phone-based fraud that was featured in the Sopranos (with Chris&#8217;s crew running the scam) and outlined nicely in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0181984/">&#8220;Boiler Room&#8221;</a>. Wikipedia has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler_room_%28business%29">nice description</a> on the scheme and origin of the term.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The reason I&#8217;m reminded of this is because I actually got a call from a boiler room, sorry, from a law office with offices in Park Avenue and London. The call could have been a scripted audition to &#8220;Boiler Room 2&#8243; to play the part of the junior associate creating warm leads to Ben Affleck&#8217;s gang. It included everything to the immortal &#8220;I will only call you if we have something really good&#8221; and &#8220;we might have something for you in 2 weeks&#8221;. Amazingly enough they did have something really good for me and exactly two weeks later I got a call from the Vin-Diesel wannabe following up on the warm lead created by the associate. Unfortunately this time I didn&#8217;t have the time to play along so I don&#8217;t know if he would have told me there&#8217;s a maximum for new clients and 5,000 shares is as much as he can sell me&#8230;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">My only complaint now is that my spam filter who is doing such a good job filtering pump-n-dumps is unable to handle human conversations and filter boiler room calls. Actually, there&#8217;s one more complaint - why is it I always get stuck in the Boiler Room-like movies instead of getting a visit from Halle Berry a-la swordfish?&#8230;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
