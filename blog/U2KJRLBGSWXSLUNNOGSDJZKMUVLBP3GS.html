				<p>I made a <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1603" target="_blank">posting</a> on the blog.</p>
<p>Then I moved on to checking news, which I do via Twitter.  And, suddenly, there in my stream was a &#8220;tweet&#8221; that, fairly obviously, referred to my posting.  By someone I didn&#8217;t know, and had never heard of.  From Indonesia.</p>
<p>This blog now has an RSS feed.  Apparently a few people are following that feed.  And, seemingly, every time something gets posted here, it gets copied onto their blogs.</p>
<p>And, in at least one case, that post gets automatically (and programmatically) posted on Twitter.</p>
<p>I would never have known any of this, except that the posting I had made was in reference to something I had found via those stalwarts at the <a href="http://www.improbable.com/" target="_blank">Annals of Improbable Research</a>.  I had made reference to that fact in the first line.  The application used to generate the Twitter posting copies roughly the first hundred characters of the blog post, so the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/improbresearch" target="_blank">Improbable Research account</a> (pretty much automatically) retweeted the programmed tweet of the blog posting that copied my original blog posting.  I follow Improbable Research on Twitter, so I got the retweet.</p>
<p>This set me to a little exploration.  I found, checking trackbacks, that every one of my postings was being copied to seven different blogs.  Blogs run by people of whom I&#8217;d never heard.  (Most of whom don&#8217;t seem to have any particular interest in infosec, which is rather odd.)</p>
<p>Well, this blog is public, and my postings are public, so I really can&#8217;t complain when the material goes public, even if in a rather larger way than I originally thought.  But it does underline the fact that, once posted on the Internet, it is very unsafe to assume that any information is confidential.  You can&#8217;t delete data once it has passed to machines beyond your control.</p>
<p>And it passes very, very fast.</p>

%T   &#8220;Steve Jobs&#8221;</p>
<p>I have read many fictional works that start off with a list of the cast of characters, but this is the first biography I&#8217;ve ever read that started in this way.</p>
<p>It is fairly obvious that Isaacson has done extensive research, talked to many people, and worked very hard in preparation for this book.  At the same time, it is clear that many areas have not been carefully analyzed.  Many Silicon Valley myths (such as the precise formulation of Moore&#8217;s Law, or John Draper&#8217;s status with regard to the Cap&#8217;n Crunch whistle) are retailed without ascertaining the true facts.  The information collected is extensive in many ways, but, in places (particularly in regard to Jobs&#8217; earlier years) the writing is scattered and disjointed.  We have Jobs living with his girlfriend in a cabin in the hills, and then suddenly he is in college.</p>
<p>Material is duplicated and reiterated in many places.  Quotes are frequently repeated word-for-word in relation to different situations or circumstances, so the reader really cannot know the original reference.  There are also contradictions: we are told that Jobs could not stand a certain staffer, but 18 pages later we are informed that the same person often enthralled Jobs.  (Initially, this staffer is introduced as having been encountered in 1979, but it is later mentioned that he worked for Jobs and Apple as early as 1976.)  At one point we learn that an outside firm designed the Mac mouse: four pages further on we ascertain that it was created internally by Apple.  The author seems to have accepted any and all input, perspectives, and stories without analysis or assessment of where the truth might lie.</p>
<p>It is possible to do a biography along a timeline.  It is possible to do it on a thematic basis.  Isaacson follows a timeline, but generally only covers one subject during any &#8220;epoch.&#8221;  From the first time Jobs sees a personal computer until he is dismissed from Apple, this is less of a biography and more the story of the development of the company.  There is a short section covering the birth of Jobs&#8217; daughter, we hear of the reality distortion field, and terse mentions of vegan diets, motorcycles, stark housing, and occasional girlfriends, but almost nothing of Jobs away from work.  (Even in covering Apple there are large gaps: the Lisa model is noted as an important development, but then is never really described.)</p>
<p>In fact, it is hard to see this book as a biography.  It reads more like a history of Apple, although with particular emphasis on Jobs.  There are sidetrips to his first girlfriend and daughter, NeXT, Pixar, miscellaneous girlfriends, his wife and kids, Pixar again, and then cancer, but by far the bulk of the book concentrates on Apple.</p>
<p>The &#8220;reality distortion field&#8221; is famous, and mentioned often.  Equally frequently we are told of a focused and unblinking stare, which Jobs learned from someone, and practiced as a means to intimidate and influence people.  Most people believe that the person who &#8220;doesn&#8217;t blink&#8221; is the dominant personality, and therefore the one in charge.  It is rather ironic that research actually refutes this.  Studies have shown that, when two people meet for the first time, it is actually the dominant personality that &#8220;blinks first&#8221; and looks away, almost as a signal that they are about to dominate the conversation or interaction.  Both &#8220;the field&#8221; and &#8220;the stare&#8221; seem to tell the same story: they are tricks of social engineering which can have a powerful influence, but which are based on an imperfect understanding of reality and people, don&#8217;t work with everyone, and can have very negative consequences.</p>
<p>(The chapters on Jobs&#8217; fight with cancer are possibly the most telling.  For anyone who has the slightest background in medicine it will be apparent that Jobs didn&#8217;t know much in that field, and that he made very foolish and dangerous decisions, flying in the face of all advice and any understanding of nutrition and biology.)</p>
<p>Those seeking insight into the character that built a major corporation may be disappointed.  Like anybody else, Jobs is a study in contradictions: the seduction with charm and vision, then belittlement and screaming at people; the perfectionist who obsessed on details, but was supposedly a visionary at the intersection of the arts and technology who made major decisions based on intuitive gut feelings with little or no information or analysis; the amaterialistic ascetic who made a fortune selling consumer electronics and was willing to con people to make money; the Zen meditator who never seemed to achieve any calm or patience; the man who insisted that &#8220;honesty&#8221; compelled him to abuse friends and colleagues, but who was almost pathological in his secrecy about himself and the company; and the creative free-thinker who created the most closed and restricted systems extent.</p>
<p>There is no attempt to find the balance point for any of these dichotomies.  As a security architect I can readily agree with the need for high level design to drive all aspects of the construction of a system: a unified whole always works better and more reliably.  Unfortunately for that premise, there are endless examples of Jobs demanding, at very late points in the process, that radically new functions be included.  Then there is Jobs&#8217; twin assertions that the item must be perfect, but that ship dates must be met.  One has to agree with Voltaire: the best is the enemy of the good, and anyone trying to be good, fast, *and* cheap may succeed a time or two, but is ultimately headed for failure.</p>
<p>Several times Isaacson repeats an assertion from Jobs that money is not important: it is merely recognition of achievements, or a resource that enables you to make great products.  The author does not seem to understand that an awful lot of money is also another resource, one that allows you to make mistakes.  He only vaguely admits that Jobs made some spectacular errors.</p>
<p>The book is not a hagiography.  Isaacson is at pains to point out that he notes Jobs&#8217; weaknesses of character and action.  At the same time, Isaacson is obviously proud of being a personal friend, and, I suspect, does not realize that, while he may mention Jobs&#8217; flaws, he also goes to great lengths to excuse them.</p>
<p>Was Steve Jobs a great man?  He was the driving force behind a company which had, for a time, the largest market capitalization of any publicly traded company.  He was also, by pretty much all accounts, an arrogant jerk.  He had a major influence on the design of personal electronics, although his contribution to personal computing was mostly derivative.  We are conventionally used to saying that people like Napoleon, Ford, and Edison are great, even thought they might have been better at social engineering than the softer people skills.  By this measure Jobs can be considered great, although not by the standards by which we might judge Ghandi, Mother Teresa, and the Dalai Lama (which is rather ironic, considering Jobs&#8217; personal philosophy).</p>
<p>Those who hold Jobs, Apple, or both, in awe will probably be delighted to find a mass of stories and trivia all in one place.  Those who want to know the secrets of building a business empire may find some interesting philosophies, but will probably be disappointed: the book tends to take all positions at once.  For those who have paid much attention to Apple, and Jobs&#8217; career, there isn&#8217;t much here that is novel.  As Jobs himself stated to a journalist, &#8220;So, you&#8217;ve uncovered the fact that I&#8217;m an *sshole.  Why is that news?&#8221;</p>
<p>Having all of the material in one book does help to clarify certain issues.  Personally, I have always fought with the Macs I used, struggling against the lock step conformity they enforced.  It was only in reviewing this work that it occurred to me that Apple relies upon a closed system that makes Microsoft appear open by comparison.  So, I guess, yes, there is at least one insight to be gained from this volume.</p>

				<p>[I've blogged on this elsewhere, but I'm pretty sure that this will be of interest to some of the readers of this blog, so here are the details as supplied by the Anti-Phishing Working Group.]</p>
<p>‘Containing the Global Cybercrime Threat’ is the focus of the Counter eCrime Operations Summit (CeCOS VI) in Prague, April 25-27</p>
<p>The 6th annual Counter eCrime Operations Summit (CeCOS VI) will convene in Prague, Czech Republic, April 25-27, 2012, as the APWG gathers global leaders from the financial services, technology, government, law enforcement, communications sectors, and research centers to define common goals and harmonize resources to strengthen the global counter-cybercrime effort.</p>
<p>CeCOS VI Prague will review the development of response systems and resources available to counter-cybercrime managers and forensic professionals from around the world.</p>
<p>Specific goals of this high-level, multi-national conference are to identify common forensic needs, in terms of the data, tools, and communications protocols required to harmonize cybercrime response across borders and between private sector financial and industrial sector responders and public sector policy professionals and law enforcement.</p>
<p>Key presentations will include:</p>
<p>» Toward a Universal eCrime Taxonomy for Industry and Law Enforcement; by Iain Swaine, Ensequrity.<br />
» Budapest Convention on Cybercrime: Transborder Law Enforcement Access to Data; by Alexander Seger, Director of the Data Protection and Cybercrime Division of the Council of Europe.<br />
» Adventures in Cybercrime Event Data Sharing; by Pat Cain, AWPG Resident Research Fellow.<br />
Additional presentations about industrial policy at CeCOS VI will investigate policies that complicate the work of exploited brand holders and responders including the domain name system (DNS) registration process that is abused by phishers as part of their phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>ABOUT the Counter eCrime Operations Summit</p>
<p>CeCOS VI, the second APWG conference held in Europe, is an open conference for members of the electronic-crime fighting community, hosted by the APWG and its Conference Partner AVG, Program Partners: The Council of Europe and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and sponsored by AVG, Google, Microsoft, MarkMonitor, ESET, Telefonica and ICANN. The CeCOS programs are widely considered the most vital events to investigators and managers of electronic crime from across the private and public sectors.</p>

				<p>I had a call today inviting me to &#8220;attend&#8221; a Webcast.  The vendor makes security products.  I work in security.  I won&#8217;t be attending.</p>
<p>I never watch Webcasts.  In the early days I watched a couple.  I even presented on a couple of Webcasts, at the request of different parties.  I&#8217;ve subsequently made it a policy that I never do attend.</p>
<p>Webcasts are a waste of time.</p>
<p>Back before Webcasts we had podcasts.  I could partially see a reason for podcasts.  After all, as the name implies, you were supposed to download them and play them on your iPod or other MP3 player.  You could do this on your commute, or while out jogging, or any other time that you would spend plugged into your device.  So, on what would normally be mental downtime, you could be learning something.</p>
<p>For me, personally, there were a couple of problems with this.  The first was that I never bothered to get an MP3 player.  The second was that I always had books to read (and <a href="http://victoria.tc.ca/int-grps/books/techrev/mnbk.htm" target="_blank">review</a>) on my commute.</p>
<p>Yes, I know I could download the podcasts to my computer, and listen to them that way.  But a) when I&#8217;m at the computer, that&#8217;s not downtime, and b) I can read faster than you can talk.  So listening to a podcast is <em><strong>still</strong></em> a waste of time.  Sorry to my friends who do podcasts, and I know you are sincerely trying to help (and probably do), but even if you are podcasting on an interesting topic, somebody else has written about it.  And I can search <em><strong>and</strong></em> read faster than you can talk.</p>
<p>The same goes, in spades, for Webcasts.  In addition, whereas podcasts are generally done by people who have something to say, but no money or major resources to say it with, Webcasts are done by vendors.  And trade rags (who are, these days, desperately trying to find something to make themselves relevant again).  And erstwhile conference and event promoters, who see it as a cheaper way to get the (advertising) message out.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s part of the trouble.  It <em><strong>is</strong></em> cheaper.  A Webcast, no matter how many frills you add (sometimes turning it into a &#8220;virtual trade show&#8221; or &#8220;virtual conference&#8221;) is going to be cheaper than renting a hotel facility, flying actual people in, laying on coffee (at hotel catering prices), and advertising your event to get people to come.  If a vendor or promoter has to do all that, they figure they might as well make sure someone is going to listen to the pitch.  So they are much more likely to make sure that a) the speaker knows how to speak, b) the speaker has something to say, and c) there is some actual useful content in addition to the straight sales pitch.</p>
<p>But a Webcast is cheap.  No rooms to rent, no people to move, no coffee to buy.  Even if you have to rent Webcast time, it&#8217;s a pittance compared to all of that.</p>
<p>And, hey! you can get people to attend more easily!  From the comfort of their own desk or computer!  Wherever they are (as long as they can get to a hotspot)!  All they have to do is register and log in!</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ll come back to that.)</p>
<p>So, if a Webcast is cheap and easy, why take any trouble with it?  Drag in anyone as a speaker.  There are probably any number of people who think they could make it big on the lecture circuit if only they got a little &#8220;exposure.&#8221;  Sorry, but I&#8217;ve run into too many people who thought I should be glad to write or speak for them just for the &#8220;exposure.&#8221;  They only people who are going to fall for that are those who don&#8217;t get asked because a) they have nothing to say, and b) they can&#8217;t say it anyway.  Even if you do find someone with something to say, why give them time (and possibly money) to research or prepare anything?  As a matter of fact, if you are a trade rag you&#8217;ve probably got lots of people who are willing to be expert on anything, with a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>
<p>Like I said, I attended a few.  It very quickly became apparent not only that I can read faster than Webcasters can speak, but that almost none of them had anything worth saying anyway.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ll make an exception for TED.  Not even all of TED.  But definitely <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/clifford_stoll_on_everything.html" target="_blank">Cliff Stoll</a>.)</p>
<p>So, I made it a policy never to attend Webcasts.  We are all busy.  My time is finite.  Webcasts are a waste of time.</p>
<p>I said I&#8217;d come back to this business of it being easy to get people to come.  Recently I&#8217;ve noticed that the Webcasts aren&#8217;t just being advertised.  Now there are bribes and come-ons.  You can win an iPod, or an IPad, if you register and attend.  You can get a USB drive if you attend.  You can get a Starbucks card or an Amazon giftcard.  (I am somewhat reminded of the studies where they offered people chocolate bars or Starbucks cards if the people would tell their passwords.)  And not only am I getting multiple invites to the event, but now telemarketers are calling to &#8220;invite&#8221; me to attend.  They are starting to sound desperate.</p>
<p>Do you think it just vaguely possible that other people are starting  to think Webcasts are a waste of time?  Maybe a large number of other people?</p>

				<p>Galina Pildush ended her LTE presentation with a very good question:&#8221;Who is responsible for LTE security?  Is it the users? UE (User Equipment, handsets and devices) manufacturers and vendors?  Network providers, operators and telcos?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great question, and one that needs to be applied to every area of security.</p>
<p>In the SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) and personal sphere, it has long been assumed that it&#8217;s the user who is responsible.  Long assumed, but possibly changing.  Apple, particularly with the iOS/iPhone/iPad lines, has moved toward a model where the vendor (Apple) locks down the device, and only allows you certain options for software and services.  Not all of them are produced or provided by Apple, but Apple gets vetting responsibilities and rights.</p>
<p>The original &#8220;user&#8221; responsibility model has not worked particularly well.  Most people don&#8217;t know how to protect themselves in regard to information security.  Malware and botnets are rampant.  In the &#8220;each man for himself&#8221; situation, many users do not protect themselves, with significant consequences for the computing environment as a whole.  (For years I have been telling corporations that they should support free, public security awareness training.  Not as advertising or for goodwill, but as a matter of self defence.  Reducing the number of infected users out there will reduce the level of risk in computing and communication as a whole.)</p>
<p>The &#8220;vendor&#8221; model, in Apple&#8217;s case (and Microsoft seems to be trying to move in that direction) has generated a reputation, at least, for better security.  Certainly infection and botnet membership rates appear to be lower in Macs than in Windows machines, and lower still in the iOS world.  (This, of course, does nothing to protect the user from phishing and other forms of fraud.  In fact, it would be interesting to see if users in a &#8220;walled garden&#8221; world were slightly more susceptible to fraud, since they were protected from other threats and had less need to be paranoid.)  The model also has significant advantages as a business model, where you can lock in users (and providers, as well), so it is obviously going to be popular with the vendors.</p>
<p>Of course, there are drawbacks, for the vendors, in this model.  As has been amply demonstrated in current mobile network situations, providers are very late in rolling out security patches.  This is because of the perception that the entire responsibility rests with the provider, and they want to test every patch to death before releasing it.  If that role falls to the vendors, they too will have to take more care, probably <em><strong>much</strong></em> more care, to ensure software is secure.  And that will delay both patch cycles and version cycles.</p>
<p>Which, of course, brings us to the providers.  As noted, there is already a problem here with patch releases.  But, after all, most attacks these days are network based.  Proper filtering would not only deal with intrusions and malware, but also issues like spam and fraud.  After all, if the phishing message never reaches the user, the user can&#8217;t be defrauded.</p>
<p>So, in theory, we can make a good case that the provider would be the most effective locus for responsibility for security.  They have the ability to address the broadest range of security issues.  In reality, of course, it wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>In the first place, all kinds of users wouldn&#8217;t stand for it.  Absent a monopoly market, any provider who tried to provide total security protection, would a) incur prohibitively heavy costs (putting pressure on their competitive rates), and b) lose a bunch of users who would resent restrictions and limitations.  (At present, of course, me know that many providers can get away with being <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1630" target="_blank">pretty cavalier</a> about security.)  The providers would also, as now, have to deal with a large range of devices.  And, if responsibility is lifted from the vendors, the situation will only get worse: vendors will be able to role out new releases and take even less care with testing than they do now.</p>
<p>In practical terms, we probably can&#8217;t, and shouldn&#8217;t decide this question.  All parties should take some responsibility, and all parties should take more than they do currently.  That way, everybody will be better off.  But, as <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1598" target="_blank">Bruce Schneier</a> notes, there are always going to be those who try and shirk their responsibility, relying on the fact that others will not.</p>

				<p>LTE.  Even the name is complex: Long-Term Evolution of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network</p>
<p>All LTE phones (UE, User Equipment) are running servers.  Multiple servers.  (And almost all are unsecured at the moment.)</p>
<p>Because of the proliferation of protocols (GSM, GPRS, CDMA, additional 3 and 4G, and now LTE), the overall complexity of the mobile/cell cloud is growing.</p>
<p>LTE itself is fairly complex.  The Protocol Reference Model contains at least the GERAN User Plane, UTRAN User Plane, and E-UTRAN User Plane (all with multiple components) as well as the control plane.  A simplified model of a connection request involves at least nine messages involving six entities, with two more sitting on the sides.  The transport layer, SCTP, has a four-way, rather than two-way, handshake.  (Hence the need for all those servers.)  Basically, though, LTE is IP, but a fairly complex set of additional protocols, as opposed to the old PSTN.  The old public telephone network was a walled garden which few understood.  Just about all the active blackhats today understand IP, and it&#8217;s open.  It&#8217;s protected by Diameter, but even the Diameter implementation was loopholes.  It has a tunnelling protocol, GTP (GPRS Tunnelling Protocol), but, like very many tunnelling protocols, GTP does not provide confidentiality or integrity protection.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to the extra speed, functions, interconnection abilities, and apps.  But all the functionality means a much larger attack surface.  The total infrastructure involved in LTE is more complex.  Maybe nobody can know it all.  But they can know enough to start messing with it.  From a simple DoS to DDoS, false billing, disclosure of data, malware, botnets of the UEs, spam, SMS trojans, even run down batteries, you name it.</p>
<p>As with VoIP before it, we are rolling our known data vulnerabilities, and known voice/telco/PBX vulnerabilities, into one big insecurity.</p>

				<p>Let me say, right off the top, that I love CanSecWest.  I am tired of &#8220;vendor&#8221; conferences, where you pay outrageous fees for the privilege of sitting through a bunch of sales pitches.  At least CanSecWest has real information, as opposed to virtual information.  (Virtual information: n. &#8211; marketing spiel dressed up as actual technical information.)</p>
<p>However, today I have had the same conversation half a dozen times, with half a dozen different people.  (And I didn&#8217;t initiate any of them.)  The conversation generally starts out the same way, with the question, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think CanSecWest is getting &#8230; less technical?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it may simply be a one year glitch, or a random set of presentations.  But, yes, I have to agree that, so far, the presentations have not been as great as in the past.</p>
<p>Still good, don&#8217;t get me wrong.  But we started with a pres on the boot process, nicely technical, but nothing new.  Pen testing, which was also pretty generic, and nothing new.  The <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1627" target="_blank">social authentication</a>, yes, that was good.  Recent research, and some neat ideas to play with.  The piece on <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1503" target="_blank">APT</a> was mostly about finding bugs in Shockwave/Flash.  The piece on Duqu and Stuxnet was good, but I feel a bit used: Kaspersky obviously timed it to present the same thing at both CanSecWest and CeBit at the same time.  Good PR hack, but a bit of a cheat in terms of &#8220;unique&#8221; presentations that haven&#8217;t been done before.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1633" target="_blank">smartphone rooting</a> had some interesting points, but didn&#8217;t demonstrate real exploits.  The <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1639" target="_blank">probing of mobile networks</a> had more real and technical data.  (Marcia Hoffman&#8217;s presentation was, last year, a personal disappointment to me, since I&#8217;m a legal and forensics guy, and expected more depth.  However, when I thought about it, I realized that she had nailed the target audience: these guys are geeks, and need the basic warnings about what they are doing.  She did just as well this year.)</p>
<p>The iOS exploitation pres was interesting but covered material that was covered quite well last year.  The piece on hardware-involved attacks boiled down to &#8220;if you don&#8217;t take care with your programming, hardware can do things you don&#8217;t expect: be a careful programmer.&#8221;  The Near Field Communications (NFC) item did raise some interesting points about the careless acceptance of chip codes, but most of it was little different from discussions about RFID or validating input in general.  (The <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1648" target="_blank">HDMI</a> was pretty cool.)</p>
<p>Like I said, I love CanSecWest, and I&#8217;m still going to come.  I may complain a bit about these presentations, but they are still far above anything you are likely to find at a vendor conference.  But I hope the program gets back to some solid, new technical stuff.</p>
<p>(By the way, if you want more details about the specific presentations, the slides are generally made available in an <a href="http://cansecwest.com/pastevents.html" target="_blank">archive</a> shortly after the event closes.  It&#8217;ll probably be <a href="http://cansecwest.com/csw12archive.html" target="_blank">this link</a>, or something similar.)</p>

				<p>Displays are monitors, right?  Strictly output, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>DVI and HDMI both support DDC, which allows for display identification and &#8220;capability advertisement.&#8221;  In other words, the display is sending information to the computer.  HDMI also has capabilities for &#8220;content protection,&#8221; and even has an ethernet channel.</p>
<p>And, of course, all these capabilities provide for neat ways to create trouble &#8230;  Lots of data comes from the display, and it has to be parsed.  And any time you are parsing data, you are, in a way, following instructions from outside the machine.</p>
<p>(Does anyone&#8217;s display programming take care not to trust the data coming from &#8220;the display&#8221;?  Care to take a guess, based on past experience?)</p>
<p>The data flying back and forth has a definite format: EDID.  There are standards.  Care to guess what can happen when you mess with the EDID data?  (And there are lots of ways it can get messed up unintentionally, starting with a simple KVM switch.)</p>
<p>In one case, experimenting was able to shut off system logging.  In another, EDID fuzzing was able to cause instability in the kernel.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve seen one in my own machine: on Win 7 and this hardware, plugging and unplugging USBs can shut off video feed to the display.  In two cases, attempting to recover the display crashed the system, hard.)</p>

				<p>Mobile networks have many disparate types of devices.  You can probably guess what some of them are, or even go to the provider&#8217;s store or kiosk and get a list.  But there are going to be more devices out there.  So why not scan the IP addresses on your subnet?</p>
<p>Well, the access points for mobile networks generally don&#8217;t allow promiscuous access.  So you may have to go to ARIN and other lists in order to start getting some ranges to check.  You can also check access logs of a Website to find visitors with mobile devices.  (Of course, there is always the NATting that the providers do, not to mention DHCP, and the fact that most mobile devices don&#8217;t run servers or services.)</p>
<p>Colin Mulliner, of the Berlin Institute of Technology, did manage to find a fair amount of interesting stuff.  Windows Mobile tended to be a useful source of open ports and services (usually open FTP services on mobile devices).  He also found and was able to identify a number of specialized devices that were identifiable from responses to probes.  Some of the most interesting were mobile access points: connecting to the mobile networks and then providing local wifi for computers.  Others were HTTP servers for surveillance cameras.  (Others were GPS tracking devices which, oddly, had no security against &#8220;guest&#8221; login  :-)  (Some were smart meters.  With smart meters rolling out here in BC, lets hope they are more secure &#8230;)</p>
<p>Possibly of concern was the large number of jailbroken iOS devices.  Many of them still had the default &#8220;alpine&#8221; password.  (If you hack your own device, you&#8217;d better be prepared to secure it.)  This could form the basis of a fair sized worm and/or botnet.  Then again, iOS users aren&#8217;t alone here.  An awful lot of people seem to think nothing of creating mobile devices and hooking them up to mobile networks with very little in the way of security.</p>

				<p>Scott Kelly, platform architect at Netflix, gets to look at a lot of devices.  In depth.  He&#8217;s got some interesting things to say about smartphones.  (At CanSecWest.)</p>
<p>First of all, with a computer, you are the &#8220;tenant.&#8221;  You own the machine, and you can modify it any way you want.</p>
<p>On a smartphone, you are not the only tenant, and, in fact, you are the second tenant.  The provider is the first.  And where you may want to modify and customize it, the provider may not want you to.  They&#8217;d like to lock you in.  At the very least, they want to maintain some control because you are constantly on their network.</p>
<p>Now, you can root or jailbreak your phone.  Basically, that means hacking your phone.  Whether you do that or not, it does mean that your device is hackable.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the system architectures for smartphones can be hugely complex.)</p>
<p>Sometimes you can simply replace the firmware.  Providers try to avoid doing that, sometimes looking at a secure boot system.  This is usually the same as the &#8220;trusted computing&#8221; (digital signatures that verify back to a key that is embedded in the hardware) or &#8220;trusted execution&#8221; (operation restriction) systems.  (Both types were used way back in AV days of old.)  Sometimes the providers ask manufacturers to lock the bootloader.  Attackers can get around this, sometimes letting a check succeed and then doing a swap, or attacking write protection, or messing with the verification process as it is occurring.  However, you can usually find easier implementation errors.  Sometimes providers/vendors use symmetric enryption: once a key is known, every device of that model is accessible.  You can also look at the attack surface, and with the complex architectures in smartphones the surface is enormous.</p>
<p>Vendors and providers are working towards trusted modules and trustzones in mobile devices.  Sometimes this is virtual, sometimes it actually involves hardware.  (Personally, I saw attempts at this in the history of malware.  Hardware tended to have inherent advantages, but every system I saw had some vulnerability somewhere.)</p>
<p>Patching has been a problem with mobile devices.  Again, the providers are going to be seen as responsible for ongoing operation.  Any problems are going to be seen as their fault.  Therefore, they really have to be sure that any patch they create is absolutely bulletproof.  It can&#8217;t create any problems.  So there is always going to be a long window for any exploit that is found.  And there are going to be vulnerabilities to exploit in a system this complex.  Providers and vendors are going to keep trying to lock systems.</p>
<p>(Again, personally, I suspect that hacks will keep on occurring, and that the locking systems will turn out to be less secure than the designers think.)</p>
<p>Scott is definitely a good speaker, and his slides and flow are decent.  However, most of the material he has presented is fairly generic.  CanSecWest audiences have come to expect revelations of real attacks.</p>

				<p>So, I&#8217;m always excited about CanSecWest, and I was yesterday, as I got ready.  I went to do a last minute download of email.  (Yes, the conference provides wireless, and it usually works, after a few initial glitches.  But I like to avoid risks, and I like to have most of my stuff with me on my machine.)</p>
<p>I could pull the email off my main account.  (I have multiple email addresses with Shaw.)  But I couldn&#8217;t get any email off the subsidiary accounts.  In order to check if this was some setting gone wrong on my MUA I tried the Web interface.  Same result: I could get at my main account, but not the subsidiary accounts.</p>
<p>Later in the day, at the conference, I was able to access all the accounts.  But I found that, while my main account was still accessible though the original interface, suddenly all the others were using a new &#8220;Webmail 2.0.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought this was kind of odd, so I reported this to Shaw through their &#8220;ShawHelp&#8221; account on Twitter.  You can&#8217;t explain a lot in 140 characters, so we passed a few &#8220;direct messages&#8221; back and forth.</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1483" target="_blank">previously</a> <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1484" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1485" target="_blank">Shaw&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1486" target="_blank">support</a> is not the best, and their <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1507" target="_blank">attitude</a> to <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1513" target="_blank">security</a> could use some work.  (As a side result of this, a friend has provided me with an emergency proxy for outbound email.  I tried it this morning, and, unlike Shaw, which requires that you be on their network before you get access to your email, it works from CanSecWest.)  So I shouldn&#8217;t have been shocked when I got a message from ShawHelp saying &#8230; well, let me quote it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not seeing issues with either of them. You can&#8217;t log into cissp? What is password so we can take a look? ^LL&#8221;</p>
<p>I had forgotten this.  In the old days, when I stilled tried to call Shaw support when I had a problem, I frequently got asked for my password.  Since I won&#8217;t give them my password (what do you think I am, a normal user?), that usually ended any attempt on their part to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>So, here we are, some years later, and Shaw is still asking their customers for passwords.  How many years have we been telling people, &#8220;customer support will never ask you for your password&#8221;?</p>
<p>On a very slightly positive note, I can say that, two months after they announced it, the Shaw Wifi AP in Lynn Valley is finally operating.</p>
<p>(I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t bash too hard on Shaw.  Their tech support and security is abysmal, but the service only goes down about once a quarter.  The other day I was at the barbershop.  They are putting in service through the other major provider in our area, Telus.  Telus&#8217; initial installation had only given them partial access, so they called in Telus&#8217; support.  The support tech managed to shut off access completely, and had been coming back, sporadically, for over a week, without success.)  (Yes, I did manage to get them partial access back &#8230;)</p>

				<p>Well, <em><strong>I</strong></em> thought it was ironic that the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204781804577267532079716926.html?mod=e2tw" target="_blank">biggest solar storm in years</a> is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/9129749/Huge-solar-flare-to-hit-Earth.html" target="_blank">hitting the earth tonight</a> &#8230; while CanSecWest is on &#8230;</p>
<p>So far today we have had talks on security (and vulnerabilities) during the boot process, a talk on pen testing (and the presenter seemed to be alternately talking about how to choose a pen tester, and how to do pen testing), and social authentication.</p>
<p>The social authentication talk was by Alex Rice from Facebook.  He noted that, even though Facebook only challenges a small fraction of a percent of logins, given the user base that means more then a million every day.  When a login is challenged, a standard response has been the good old &#8220;security questions&#8221;: mother&#8217;s maiden name, birthdate, and other pieces of information that might not be too hard for someone intent on breaking into your account to find out.</p>
<p>Alex went through the limitations of security questions, and then moved to other possibilities.  Security questions comes under the heading of &#8220;things you know,&#8221; so they looked at &#8220;things you have.&#8221;  For example, you have to have an email address, so there is the possibility of a challenge sent to your email.  (Google, of course, figures that everyone in the world has a cell phone that can receive text messages.)</p>
<p>Recently, Facebook has started to use the photos that people post on their pages, particularly those that have been tagged.  Basically, if your login gets challenged, you will be shown a series of pictures, and you should be able to identify who is, or is not, in the picture, out of your list of friends.  This is the subject of a <a href="http://crosslandteam.com/blog/2010/08/29/my-facebook-login-lockout-ordeal-and-how-i-prevailed/" target="_blank">blog post noting that it isn&#8217;t perfect</a>.</p>
<p>There are additional problems.  As the post notes, the situation is less than ideal if you have a huge number of &#8220;friends.&#8221;  (As <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1598" target="_blank">Bruce Schneier&#8217;s new book</a> notes, if you have more than 150 friends, you probably aren&#8217;t friends with many of them.)  Even if you do know your &#8220;friends,&#8221; there is nothing to say that any given picture of them will be recognizable.  In fact, since the system relies on tagging, there are going to be pictures of weird objects that people have deliberately tagged as themselves, in joking fashion.</p>
<p>Therefore, this system is definitely not perfect, as the questions at the end pointed out.  Unfortunately, Alex had passed, rather quickly, over an important point.  The intent of the system, in Facebook&#8217;s opinion, was to reduce the amount of account spam sent via accounts that had been compromised.  In that regard, the system probably works very well.  False logins get challenged.  Some of the challenges are false positives.  The photo system is a means of allowing a portion (a fairly large portion, probably) of users to recover their accounts quickly.  For the remaining accounts, there are other means to recover the account, even though these are more time-consuming for both Facebook and the user.  This system does reduce the total amount of time spent by both users (in the aggregate, even if individual users may feel hard done by) and Facebook.</p>

<p>I had the chance to hang out at the SECCDC yesterday at Kennesaw State Univ.  For those not familiar with these events (I wasn&#8217;t either, until yesterday), you have colleges who bring in teams to defend against a &#8216;red team&#8217;.  UNC Charlotte defended their network better than the other colleges.  It was interesting to see these schools throwing in block filters, redirects, etc. on the fly.  Impressive from a bunch of college students.  The red team was equally impressive.  There wasn&#8217;t a box that they didn&#8217;t, at some point, root thoroughly&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One interesting note.  During the competition, there was a full power outage.  UPSes died.  Images were lost.  Router configs were killed.  It generally set the entire competition back a few hours (at least).  Just a reminder that physical security is every bit as important as the logical security&#8230;.</p>

				<p>I always look forward to <a href="http://cansecwest.com/" target="_blank">CanSecWest</a>.  Usually cutting edge stuff.  Some of it incomprehensible, some of it interesting, some very entertaining.</p>
<p>Every year is a different program, of course, but every year has some changes to the setup, as well.  This year is the latest I can remember them opening the doors to the ballroom/theatre, but it was also one of the earliest in terms of starting the registrations.</p>
<p>Between getting registered and getting in to the room there&#8217;s some time to mingle.  It was nice to see old friends, including some whose presence surprised me.  Also nice to meet a few new people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always interesting who you run into at CanSecWest.  One friend, on his first time out, sat down next to a nice chap, and got to talking.  Said chap shortly asked my friend to mind his computer for the next little while, then walked up to the front and was introduced as the next speaker, Charlie Miller.  Miller is a bit of a fixture at the event, as he tends to win the Pwn2Own contest year after year.  You&#8217;ve probably heard of his escapades in other areas.</p>
<p>(As I say, lots of nice people here.  However, this is definitely a conference on the geek end of the spectrum, and you can often count on running into people whose &#8220;people skills&#8221; could use work.  It makes starting up conversations with strangers possibly more surprising than usual  :-)</p>
<p>Not as many vendors at CanSecWest as at other conferences.  Some interesting ones this year: one company doing managed security and reselling.  They are looking at the enterprise and government market, and I suspect they may be at the wrong conference.  Adobe is here: they seem to be trying to overcome the perception of them as the problem.  A number of companies appear to be primarily interested in recruiting.  (If they are really serious about it, they might have sent more technical people: a number of tables are staffed by sales people who are having difficulty talking to the geeks they are trying to recruit.)</p>
<p>As usual, getting connected to the CanSecWest network was a bit of a challenge, but I seem to be on now  :-)</p>

				<p>OK, having now had this conversation twice, I&#8217;ve gone back to the true source of all wisdom on all things viral, &#8220;Viruses Revealed.&#8221;  I got it off my shelf, of course, but some helpful vxer (who probably thought he was going to harm our sales) <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/ars08.html" target="_blank">posted it on the net</a>, and saved David and I the bother.  (Remember, this guy is a vxer, so that page may not be entirely safe.)</p>
<p>Michelangelo is covered between pages 357 and 361, which is slightly over halfway through the book.  However, since I guess he&#8217;s missed out the index and stuff, it turns out to be at about the 3/4 mark on the page he&#8217;s created.</p>
<p>Anyway, Michelangelo checks the date via Interrupt 1Ah.  many people did not understand the difference between the MS-DOS clock and the system clock read by Interrupt 1Ah. The MS-DOS DATE command did not always alter the system clock. Network-connected machines often have &#8220;time server&#8221; functions so that the date is reset to conform to the network. The year 1992 was a leap year, and many clocks did not deal with it properly. Thus, for many computers, 6th March came on Thursday, not Friday.</p>

				<p>Graham Cluley, of <a href="http://www.sophos.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Sophos</a> and <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/" target="_blank">Naked Security</a>, posted some <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/03/05/michelangelo-virus/" target="_blank">reminiscences of the Michelangelo virus</a>.  It brought back some memories and he&#8217;s told the story well.</p>
<p>I hate to argue with Graham, but, first off, I have to note that the twentieth anniversary of Micelangelo is not tomorrow (March 6, 2012), but today, March 5.  That&#8217;s because 1992 was, as this year is, a leap year.  Yes, Michelangelo was timed to go off on March 6th every year, but, due to a shortcut in the code (and bugs in normal comptuer software), it neglected to factor in leap years.  Therefore, in 1992 many copies went off a day early, on March 5th.</p>
<p>March 5th, 1992, was a rather busy day for me.  I was attending a seminar, but kept getting called out to answer media enquiries.</p>
<p>And then there was the fact that, after all that work and information submitted to the media in advance, and creating copies of Michelangelo on a 3 1/2&#8243; disk (it would normally only infect 5 1/4&#8243;s) so I could test it on a safe machine (and then having to recreate the disk when I accidentally triggered the virus), it wasn&#8217;t me who got my picture in the paper.  No, it was my baby brother, who a) didn&#8217;t believe in the virus, but b) finally, at literally the eleventh hour (11 pm on March 4th) decided to scan his own computer (with a scanner I had given to him), and, when he found he was infected, raised the alarm with his church, and scanned their computers as well.  (Must have been pretty close to midnight, and zero hour, by that time.)  That&#8217;s a nice human interest story so <em><strong>he</strong></em> got his picture in the paper.  (Not that I&#8217;m bitter, mind you.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite agree with Graham as to the infection rates.  I do know that, since this was the first time we (as the nascent antivirus community) managed to get the attention of the media in advance, there were a great many significant infections that were cleaned off in time, before the trigger date.  I recall notices of thousands of machines cleaned off in various institutions.  But, in a sense, we were victims of our own success.  Having got the word out in advance, by the trigger date most of the infections had been cleaned up.  So, yes, the media saw it as hype on our part.  And then there was the fact that a lot of people had no idea when they got hit.  I was told, by several people, &#8220;no, we didn&#8217;t get Michelangelo.  But, you know, it&#8217;s strange: our computer had a disk failure on that date &#8230;&#8221;  That was how Michelangelo appeared, when it triggered.</p>
<p>I note that one of the comments wished that we could find out who created the virus.  There is strong evidence that it was created in Taiwan.  And, in response to a posting that I did at the time, I received a message from someone, from Taiwan, who complained that it shouldn&#8217;t be called &#8220;Michelangelo,&#8221; since the <em><strong>real</strong></em> name was &#8220;Stoned 3.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve always felt that only the person who wrote that variant would have been that upset about the naming &#8230;</p>
