				<p>Sometimes I dislike how media deals with security news, always looking for the next scoop. Take the buzz around &#8220;WiFi Epidemiology: Can Your Neighbors&#8217; Router Make Yours Sick?&#8221; paper, by Indiana University researchers. Excerpt from Network World article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the researchers did not develop any attack code that would be used to carry out this infection, they believe it would be possible to write code that guessed default passwords by first entering the default administrative passwords that shipped with the router, and then by trying a list of one million commonly used passwords, one after the other. They believe that 36% of passwords can be guessed using this technique.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is a dejavu. I remember Renderman (<a href="http://www.churchofwifi.org/">Church of Wifi</a>) suggested a similar scenario in his talk &#8220;<a href="http://www.churchofwifi.org/default.asp?PageLink=Project_Display.asp?PID=98">New Wireless Fun From the Church Of WiFi</a>&#8220;. At <a href="http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-14/dc-14-speakers.html#RenderMan">DEFCON 14</a> (2006). Including the usage of third-party-firmware.</p>
<p>The guys over at Indiana University didn&#8217;t develop any exploit for that, so I think I can develop all this theory a little bit. For good.</p>
<p>What about a Wi-Fi healer instead of a attack, a World Wide WEP Wipe (WWWW) or something like that? A wardriving device which breaks into WEP WAPs and &#8220;heals&#8221; it with WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSK using a database of known administration interface URL (forÂ  popular models, for most firmware versions). Maybe it would not be necessary to even change the WEP key since breaking WEP is a matter of resouces and time and breaking WPA-PSK is a matter of luck (bad, easy guessable keys + cowpatty &#8220;classic&#8221;, cowpatty with lookup tables, aircrack-ng). Some users wouldn&#8217;t even notice the new security scheme once you keep the same key <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<p>The first spyware spreading with Facebook application has been discovered. Security company Fortinet <a href="http://www.fortiguardcenter.com/advisory/FGA-2007-16.html">reports</a> that application called Secret Crush is installing Zango (aka AdWare.Win32.180Solution) with Iframe, technically from ZangoCash.com.</p>
<p>Shortly, this is the spreading mechanism:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In opening the request, the recipient is informed that one of his/her friends has invited him/her to find out more information by using &#8220;Secret Crush&#8221; (this happens frequently with Facebook&#8217;s Platform Application). [Figure 2] exhibits the social engineering speech employed by the malicious widget to get the user to install it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The text included to the request entry is <em>&#8220;One of Your Friends Might Have a Crush on You!&#8221;</em>. Additionally, the buttons are &#8216;Find Out Who!&#8217; and typical &#8216;Ignore&#8217;.<br />
It appears that Secret Crush is not included to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/index.php?category=0">Facebook Application Directory</a> (no log-in needed) any more. Reportedly FortiGuard Team has informed Facebook guys and probably the application has been disabled already.</p>
<p><strong>Update 4th Jan:</strong> The application mentioned is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=6009599924">located here</a> (renamed to My Admirer), still accessible and has &#8220;50,708 daily active users i.e. 4% of total&#8221;.</p>
<p>The exact number of affected users is not available.
</p>

				<p>2007 was the brazilian Christmas for laptops, definitely. Finally the prices are reasonable in retail stores, now one can buy a basic laptop for about R$1.600,00 (about US$950). That&#8217;s expensive for a 256MB / 512MB Celeron PC, but hey, that&#8217;s much better than feeding the parallel market of &#8220;contrabando&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a side effect, more Muni Wi-Fi and similar initiatives are emerging in the last few months. The last one came to my attention yesterday: Wi-Fi in Copacabana beach.</p>
<p>Sounds cool, huh? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha">Caipirinhas</a>, lots of hot girls in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-string">fio dental</a>, and Wi-Fi (you geek!). Don&#8217;t do it, man.</p>
<p>Burglars in Brazil are smart, so be a ninja with your laptop in Brazil. Let your Targus bag at home, it looks like &#8220;hey I have a laptop, please steal it from me Mr. Bag Guy&#8221;. Be a ninja with other gadgets like iPods, digital cameras and cell phones too. Nothing in your belt too, Mr. Batman.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi in malls is relatively safe, just take care when you&#8217;re leaving the place, looking back is always good. Airports are safer, but take care in your way to the hotel, when you&#8217;re waiting for a taxi. Recently a gang was arrested, they were specialized in laptops. You know, it&#8217;s easy to know you have a laptop because people help burglars a lot: suits and backpacks (specially Targus and other mainstream brands) don&#8217;t mix.<br />
Another tip: the vast majority of hotspots in Brazil are associated to <a href="http://www.vexcorp.com.br/index.php?ididioma=3">Vex</a>, so purchasing some credits before you leave your country in a safe network would be interesting. Another tip, actually a homework before you leave your country: backup your data, protect your HD with a password if available, encrypt the file system, have your VPN set.</p>
<p>Via: <a href="http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/informatica/ult124u359716.shtml">Praia de Copacabana deve ter rede Wi-Fi atÃ© junho (FolhaOnline 01/02/2007)</a>

				<p>Howdy ho from Brazil, folks.</p>
<p>Remember that vulnerability in Gmail filter feature reported by Petko D. Petkov in September? Google fixed this vulnerability a few days after it was disclosed, but something was missing: end users should be noticed about that.<br />
Early this week I was made aware of someone who was hit hard by this vuln months after it was fixed. David Airey&#8217;s domain was hijacked and this vulnerability helped on that.</p>
<p>But Google fixed that, what&#8217;s the problem? They should have noticed all users about that. New filters could not be injected anymore after the fix, but filters injected before the fix were still there. A simple &#8220;please check you filters&#8221; Web two-dot-oh notice would be enough, only if new filters were added in the days between the vuln was disclosed and the fix. End users don&#8217;t read the same blogs, lists and security resources that we read. Users are not supposed to know the nuts and bolts of the vulnerability, but they should know what manual actions should be taken.<br />
I don&#8217;t know about you, but I thought about some solutions for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anything under settings should require password, in every change. I guess Yahoo! Mail works like that;</li>
<li>Filters that forward messages should be handled in a different way, maybe under &#8220;Forwarding and POP/IMAP&#8221; tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another simple mitigation action that people should use for any online service is something like a privilege separation (I don&#8217;t have a better name for that). Use different accounts for different purposes, have a master account and child accounts that forward every message to the master account.</p>
<p>If you are a moderator in a Yahoo! Group don&#8217;t use your main personal profile for group management, for example. Reducing the lifetime of the session to 15 minutes and log in only on trustworthy networks are other paranoid measures that could be considered. If there&#8217;s a targeted attack against your account probably your less critical account will be affected.<br />
Do you have any insight about this Gmail vuln? Comment.<br />

				<p>Every once in awhile I get an opportunity to work on a &#8220;known&#8221; vulnerability, but with very little or even no available technical details. These known vulnerabilities tend to be &#8220;known&#8221; just to their finder and to the vendor that fixed the vulnerability. We know they exist because an advisory is published, but not much more than that.<br />
From the point where the vulnerability got fixed, no one (researcher or vendor) has any interest in disclosing the vulnerability details - as it is no longer interesting - leaving security researchers with insufficient information to confirm whether this vulnerability affects anyone else beside the specific vendor - and specific vendor version.</p>
<p>This is the point I reached today, where our team wanted to update a test of our vulnerability scanner to check for the exploitability of a certain vulnerability on a new platform. The version indicated it was vulnerable to the problem but there was no way to confirm it as the vulnerability&#8217;s technical description was inadequate, and checking only the version is a sure way for multitude of false positives.<br />
With the little information available:<br />
<em>The get_server_hello function in the SSLv2 client code in OpenSSL 0.9.7 before 0.9.7l, 0.9.8 before 0.9.8d, and earlier versions allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (client crash) via unknown vectors that trigger a null pointer dereference.</em></p>
<p>I was determined to discover what was the &#8220;unknown vector&#8221; and see whether the product I tested was in fact vulnerable or not.</p>
<p>First step was to understand what the SSLv2 exactly is, and how I can get it - well simple enough here, &#8220;openssl s_client&#8221; is just what I needed - it was a sample SSL client that utilizes the get_server_hello() function.</p>
<p>Then I needed to create an SSLv2 session, this proved to be a bit more difficult as SSLv2 is now considered insecure and most SSL installations disable it - further Firefox no longer allows connecting to those sites that support it&#8230; but apparently Apache 2 haven&#8217;t given up on it, and you can turn SSLv2 support quite easily through the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslprotocol">SSLProtocol</a> definition.</p>
<p>Once that was available, I launched beSTORM&#8217;s auto-learn mechanism and made it capture the SSLv2 traffic - a complete session can be quite extensive but I only needed the first packets as they were the one get_server_hello() function looks into - once this was ready I used the pcap export capabilities to load the captured data into Wireshark - and use Wireshark&#8217;s existing dissection to mark which fields where what - who was the length of what, what was a flag, etc.</p>
<p>Then I told beSTORM to start listening on incoming traffic and play around with the values, I mainly concentrated on the following ServerHello parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Packet Length (total length)</li>
<li>Session ID Hit (valid value is either set to 0&#215;01 or set to 0&#215;00)</li>
<li>Certificate Type (it is an enumeration of three possible values)</li>
<li>Certificate Length</li>
<li>Certificate Value</li>
<li>Cipher Spec Length</li>
<li>Cipher Spec Value</li>
<li>Connection ID Length</li>
<li>Connection ID Value</li>
</ul>
<p>After a few thousands of combinations - taking about 50 minutes - with beSTORM modifying the Session ID Hit (set to 0&#215;00), Certificate Type set to NULL (0&#215;00), Certificate Length equal to 0, Certificate Value set to none, Cipher Spec Length equal to 0, Cipher Spec Value set to none and the default captured values of Connection ID - the openssl client crashed:</p>
<p><em>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.<br />
0&#215;0808638d in get_server_hello (s=0&#215;81aed90) at s2_clnt.c:542<br />
542             if (s->session->peer != s->session->sess_cert->peer_key->x509)</em></p>
<p>Now all I needed was to instruct beSTORM to build a module from it - job done.</p>
<p>From a very vague description to an exploit in about an hour <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<p>The last week of December is sometimes an interesting week in our industry.</p>
<p>IT security is often pictured as a fight between the &#8216;good guys&#8217; and the &#8216;bad guys&#8217;. Well, from December 25th to January 1st, the battlefield is noticeably skewed in favor of the bad guys.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not too difficult to see why - the CSO&#8217;s are on vacation. The IT staff is minimal. Nobody would risk deploying a patch that would affect the entire company come January 1st (and who wants his boss to come back to work after a New Year&#8217;s party and find out her computer doesn&#8217;t boot). On the vendor side, things are similar; you better not find a critical exploitable buffer overflow in this critical week - they&#8217;ll be no one to fix it. Or deploy a workaround.</p>
<p>Last year, Determina reported the .ANI buffer overflow to Microsoft in December, but the acknowledgment from MS only came in early January (not to mention the patch itself came in March).<br />
Two years ago the WMF exploit made noise and since the Microsoft engineers were on vacation <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/176">Ilfak</a> and <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/?p=640">ZERT</a> had to pitch in and release 3rd party patches for this problem.</p>
<p>In Christmas 2004, Ironically enough, Microsoft was busy with the first .ANI vulnerability (this one reported by eeye) almost identical to the one that followed 2 years after and again a patch that waited until after the MS QA team had time to recover from the New Year&#8217;s hangover.</p>
<p>Six years ago, David Litchfield turned Oracle&#8217;s then marketing tagline &#8220;Unbreakable&#8221; into pure mockery by discovering a serious of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities which of course were not patched in time for Santa Claus season.</p>
<p>These stories remind me of the Christmas party at the Nakatomi building in &#8220;Die Hard&#8221;, only in our case the attackers have the additional benefit of the &#8220;out of office&#8221; messages telling them who left their post (not to mention not all companies have John McLain to save them from imminent doom).</p>
<p>Will this holiday season be quiet? So far there aren&#8217;t any clouds on the horizon, so lets hope it stays that way for another 10 days or so. After all, even us security folks need our R&#038;R&#8230;</p>
<p>Happy holidays everyone!
</p>

				<p>Recently the security industry has found new hybrid viruses which top anything previously known. They are saying that virus producers now are almost like a terrorist group, they have funding, they have research and development teams,Â etc. It should be expected really, as there are obviously hate groups all over, particularly Muslim I guess, and they are willing to blow them selves up just to attack the West.Â </p>
<p><strong>What do these hybrid viruses do?Â </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>One such virus found in 2007 was named âStormâ, and has been called a Worm and Trojan as well as VirusÂ because it has features of both, I just call themÂ all viruses. Storm actually has capabilities of an SMTP relay apparently, and some sort of Socket server with the capability to communicate stolen information to many destinations, even the ability to communicate and warn itâs own Storm infected host computers across a network of many Storm infected computers. One report said this Storm creates a Botnet of computers with combined criminal computing power greater then IBMâs best super-computers. This virus has features which I really do not want to state because I donât want to proliferate virus design. This virus starts in an eMail containing an executable attachment, the dumb users are tricked into running the attachment. Thatâs typical. Experts are estimating that this Storm virus has infected more then 200 million computers around the world, by email, and only the US and Europe have gotten some control of it at this time.Â <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Whatâs the solution?</strong>Â </p>
<p>Actually the solution is to not execute any program from any source except your trustworthy business associates, within the US preferably. But where ever you are you need to have educated and trustworthy associates, so they don&#8217;t accidentallyÂ propagate viruses.Â However with eMails you also need to be sure they are legitimate, notÂ artificially produced by a spam virus using your friend&#8217;s eMail address.Â Thatâs the rule for me, but many of my clients just canât keepÂ these rules, so I install good Anti-virus software on their computers.</p>
<p>There are a lot of anti-virus packages out there, but big names are not always best. For example Trend-Micro is recommended by many but tests have shown it is not that thorough, and Microsoft has been unwilling to participate and prove the quality of their AV software. McAfee is what I use forÂ many of myÂ clients and it has an excellent track record for many years with a low price, though IÂ also useÂ Symantec which isÂ possibly the best of all.Â </p>
<p>I know better then to run any eMail attachment, or download and run any questionable software product from non-american companies particularly, so I have actually not had a virus that I can remember. And I have not used Anti-virus software for near 10 years on my computers. Well, pre 2000 I think I had some minor virus problems, and I unfortunately downloaded and used some over-seas software and started having computer problems, so I backed everything up and wiped my hard drive clean. Thatâs how I solve my virus problems. Were you expecting some elaborate solution? True, you need more advanced solutions particularly for big networksâ¦Â </p>
<p><strong>Advanced corporate solutions:Â </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Most importantly, again, the solution is to not execute a questionable program. This is especially important on servers, and ultra important for administrators to be careful not to run any questionable program. Second you need good Firewall solutions implemented on your network, this holds down such things as the Storm virus. These things are standard practice of course. I have actually averted these problems all together for administration by using a product called Iron-Admin from WiseFirm, I use it to administer all of my customerâs servers and workstations. This product allows you to administer all your network computers from one workstation, including Windows and Unix/Solaris/Linux servers, and you donât ever have to execute any programs at all. Iron-Admin uses high-encryption for all itâs communications, and from one computer you can remotely administer 100s of servers and limitless workstations, and do backups of them all at scheduled times. Another similar product which I have tried is InterStructures, but it is not compatible with AIX and Solaris and does not do backups.</p>
<p>You may use Anti-virus software, but honestly it is over-rated. Consider the case of a new virus, such as Storm, in this case your Anti-virus software will not recognize it initially. If your company is so unfortunate that this virus gets access to administration level servers, your whole companyâs data could fall. Anti-virus software is a good step to protect common userâs computers to a limited degree, and to stop a virus eventually after it has been discovered.Â </p>
<p>I will get into more details on the security factors we have looked at in this article, and some additional ones. Look for my future blogs here.Â </p>
<p>Â

				<p>An Orkut based virus/worm appears to be on the loose, it propagates by posting notes on people&#8217;s scrapbook. So chances are that if you got a new scrapbook item on your long-unused Orkut it is because the worm has infected one of your friends there.</p>
<p>The virus/worm utilizes javascript code to propagate. The source of it can be found here: hxxp://files.myopera.com/virusdoorkut/files/virus.js<br />
Update: Google apparently is actively deleting items from the scrapbook of people that were infected and that have infected others.</p>
<p>Update 2: More details can be found here: <a href="http://antrix.net/journal/techtalk/orkut_xss.html">http://antrix.net/journal/techtalk/orkut_xss.html</a>

				<p><a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/767">I&#8217;ve said it before</a> - some vendors just don&#8217;t get it. Security culture isn&#8217;t something you can fake.</p>
<p>Well, according to <a title="be Customers still exposed" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/16/be_still_exposed/">theregister</a>, beThere customers are still vulnerable to the security flaw <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/826">Sid reported here</a> back in February. When you think about the fact this has been reported to beThere long before Sid published the details, you can see how embarrassing the situation is.<br />
Some companies think security advisories should be handled by the PR department. Well, it shouldn&#8217;t. And if you&#8217;re a beThere customer, fix your system pronto, and take note of your ISP&#8217;s attitude when it comes to your security.

<p>Pushdo is interesting since it was written for &#8220;future use&#8221; - i.e. it updates itself to obey his master&#8217;s latest needs and requests. It also has intelligence-collecting routines and in general shows how sophisticated the bad guys are getting.

				<p>We recently introduced a few improvements to our <a href="http://www.beyondsecurity.com/bestorm_overview.html">beSTORM</a> fuzzing framework to make it test for things other than the common buffer overflow, format strings, integer overflow, off-by-one, etc. These includes less common vulnerabilities like command execution and code injection. These type of vulnerabilities are more complicated to test as they require close integration with the product being tested - namely monitor what it tries to open (similar to what filemon does) and what it tries to execute (in the case of Perl, PHP, etc).</p>
<p>Armed with these new tests we took one of the candidate we knew had no vulnerabilities of &#8220;common&#8221; ones as it is written in Perl, as such it was never audited for vulnerabilities, launched our fuzzing module for <a href="http://www.hl7.org/">HL7</a> (Health Level 7) and awaited for the results, after several hundred of tests it detected something very particular:</p>
<p>Sending:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>\x0bMSH|^~\\&#038;|||||20071203173658|||20071203173658.98 \x0d`/usr/bin/whoami`|||XXX|\x0d\x1c\x0d</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of the &#8220;normal&#8221; - non fuzzed traffic:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>\x0bMSH|^~\\&#038;|||||20071203173658|||20071203173658.98 \x0dMSH|||XXX|\x0d\x1c\x0d</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Caused the program located under /usr/bin/whoami to get launched, of course this isn&#8217;t a ready made exploit or it is a vulnerability none the less, you can probably guess what the next step is <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Update: The author of the program has promptly fixed the vulnerability and has released a new version, accessible by using the toolkit&#8217;s CVS version.<br />
P.S: even though the software hasn&#8217;t been updated since March 2005, several vendors provide it as part of their HL7 implementations.</p>
<p>A CVE has been given to this vulnerability: <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6264">CVE-2007-6264</a>
</p>

				<p>The number of recent QuickTime PoC&#8217;s is remarkable large and the active exploitation has begun as well, as many of the readers know.</p>
<p>However, the QuickTime RTSP vulnerability reported on 23th Nov is not the only one.</p>
<p>It appears that WabiSabiLabi team <a href="http://wabisabilabi.blogspot.com/2007/11/quicktime-zeroday-vulnerability-still.html">has reported</a> that there is another (they call it zero-day vuln) flaw in Apple&#8217;s QuickTime player too.</p>
<p>This is what their blog post states:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We just want to specify that the vulnerability shown on those POCs <span style="font-weight: bold">IS NOT</span> <a href="http://wslabi.com/wabisabilabi/showBidInfo.do?code=ZD-00000185">the one present</a> in our marketplace.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>They are pointing to PoCs listed at Milw0rm etc.</p>
<p>And a summary:</p>
<p>The first issue reported by <strong>Krystian Kloskowski</strong> (aka h07) is <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6166">CVE-2007-6166</a> -  CVSS score 9.3. For workarounds see US-CERT <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/659761">VU#659761</a>.</p>
<p>The second issue reported by unknown person is <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6238">CVE-2007-6238</a> - CVSS score 10.0. Reportedly &#8216;Affected system:                          Windows XP&#8217;.

				<p>We have been asked by one of our customers to provide a <a href="http://www.beyondsecurity.com/bestorm_overview.html">beSTORM</a> fuzzing module for the FIX protocol, for those who don&#8217;t know what FIX is - in laymen terms it what allows the world of finance to work as it is part of the Financial Information eXchange, the protocol is fairly simple and very insecure - not just because it is textual.</p>
<p>I will update you guys as soon as I can provide more details.

<p>Also, the folks at <a href="http://www.securitycompass.com/">Security Compass</a> have released some new firefox plugins which should aid in detecting SQL injection and XSS.  I&#8217;m between gigs, but will give these a good test drive the next time I&#8217;m tasked with a web application.</p>
<p>If one doesn&#8217;t already exist, I&#8217;d like an open source &#8220;Reporting Framework&#8221;.  A metasploit for power reporters.  I spend at least 10% of my consulting hours on reporting.  I hate reporting.  Feed this tool your reports and get back a standard report in the template of your choosing.  All cross-referencing with CVE, CVSS, BID, NIST, etc. should be automagic.  Relevant references should be automatically inserted (links to patches, standards, etc.).  There should even be an option for uploading screen shots which are tagged to an IP/FQDN and service&#8230;</p>
<p>Enjoy the Holiday of your choosing,</p>
<p>!Dmitry
