<html><body><h2>Network Scanners and Flash</h2><br>August 22nd, 2009<br><br>

				<p>So, obviously, network and application scanners are targeting flash &#8216;.swf&#8217; (swiff) files.  These scanners decompile and then do static analysis on the code.  Very cool stuff.  There are several that I know of that are handling swiff code in this manner.</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.communities.hp.com/securitysoftware/search/SearchResults.aspx?q=swfscan">SWFScan</a>  (sorry for linking to a forum search, but there is no nice clean URI for this product)</p>
<p>2) <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ratproxy/">Ratproxy</a> which uses  <a href="http://www.nowrap.de/flare.html">Flare</a></p>
<p>If I had the time, I&#8217;d like to see how these automated scanners handle malformed swiff files 
.</p>
<p>A quick question for those more familiar with flash security tools: is there an open source lib for decompiling flash swiff files?  Comment here or shoot me an email at dmitry.chan@gmail.com</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
