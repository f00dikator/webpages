				<p>I&#8217;m hyped!  The much-anticipated Maltego version 2.0 is out.  I had previously alluded to maltego <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/1042">here</a>.  To the 1% of you who haven&#8217;t heard of Maltego, it&#8217;s a tool for determining relationships between domains, users, email addresses, etc.  I can&#8217;t think of an Infosec or traditional corporate security group which wouldn&#8217;t benefit from this tool.  Check out new features <a href="http://www.paterva.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.paterva.com/maltego/">here</a>.</p>
<p>OK, everyone is probably familiar with the riddle put forth by Samson.  e.g. &#8220;From the eater came forth food; and from the strong came forth sweet.&#8221;. The answer to that riddle was hidden.  Who could have guessed the meaning?  The strength of the riddle was in the fact that it was based on subjective knowledge that only Samson possessed.  Of course, the story ends badly due to philistine subterfuge&#8230;but, I digress.  I know that the security industry puts forth much effort in solving the riddle of &#8220;spam&#8221;.  Question one, would a person, solving the spam riddle, be best served in keeping the answer to himself?  It would seem that any sort of public solution would give the spammer equal opportunity to adjust their attack vector.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about spam.  Google (and their gmail app) seem to know a lot about spam <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  .  Joe Stewart over at Secureworks knows a lot about spam.  He claims that the top botnets can send over <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/www.secureworks.com/research/threats/topbotnets/">100 billion spams per day</a>.  I have a few more ignorant questions:</p>
<p>2) Spam is a nuisance.  Can the power of spam be harnessed and used against ones enemies?  If spam is the &#8220;eater&#8221;, how can it be used to ones advantage?</p>
<p>3) The sending of spam seems highly automated.  Can the power of spam be turned inward?  Like a child scooping cuploads of black ants on a red ant mount, is there a way of causing a &#8220;war&#8221; between spambots?  Would such a war benefit anyone?</p>
