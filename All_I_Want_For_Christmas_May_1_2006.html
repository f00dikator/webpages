<html><body><h2>All I want for Christmas is this Google feature</h2><br>May 1, 2006<br><br>

Here is what I want for Christmas. Yes, it’s only May, but I figure I had better get my requests in quick ;)<br><br>

I want to be able to search for binary files by checksum. Simple, right?
<br><br>
A few applications where I would find this useful:
<br><br>
1) I pay some creative genius thousands of dollars to create my company icons (or web page, or whatever). I’d like to checksum those files and google for pages which have image files which match that checksum. I’d also like to know when Google first noticed that file on website X (i.e. did I receive stolen icons or were my icons stolen?).
<br><br>
2) OK, I really only have one reason for requesting this new feature…however, I bet spooks worldwide could make use of this as well. Inject some kiddy pr0n onto a P2P network and then use your BigBrotherIsh passive sniffers to see who/where your pr0n ends up.
<br><br>
That’s it. I’d like to thank Google for considering my request ;)
