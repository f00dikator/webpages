<html><body><h2>Getting out of the box : The problem of Babel</h2><br>January 2nd, 2007<br><br>


<p>A few years back, I worked for this company that subjected all their employees to &#8216;out-of-the-box&#8217; training.   It was a non-grueling, week-long seminar that was mandatory for all IT disciplines and included team-building exercises, personality inventories, group puzzles, creative-thinking exercises, etc.  At the end of the week, we were supposed to be equipped to solve problems in creative ways.  It was very lame.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Security groups were way out of the box.  In fact, most didn&#8217;t even acknowledge the existence of a box.  Over the years, they have not only invented the box - they have reverse-houdinied themselves into the box.  How did that happen?</p>
<p>1) Security has become increasingly complex.</p>
<p>2) The single human brain can only master a finite amount of information.</p>
<p>3) Niche skills become the norm.</p>
<p>Add all this up and you get what I call &#8220;The problem of Babel&#8221;.  We are creating (have created) a growth-limiting caste system.  Instead of building a large Tower which would enhance our view of the landscape and feed our creativity,  we have dotted the landscape with disjoint  chimneys.  The chimney&#8217;s rarely touch, have no solid base for high growth, are limited in size and scope, and end up trapping those inside.</p>
