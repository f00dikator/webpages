<html><body><h2>More Email fun</h2><br>July 1st, 2010<br><br>



				<p>I love parsing public data.  I blogged about it here <a href="http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/328">http://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/328</a>  about 4 years ago (wow, how time flies)</p>
<p>Now, there is a new set of email data from Supreme Court Justice nominee Elena Kagan which the Sunlight Foundation folks put into a nice gmail interface here: <a href="http://elenasinbox.com/">http://elenasinbox.com/</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the dump from the archives looks to be in PDF format.  I&#8217;m hoping there is a way to get the plain text dump of these emails.  I&#8217;ve contacted the Sunlight guys and hope to get a chance to run some parsing algorithms shortly <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Update: Tom Lee and Jake Brewer quickly responded and shared their methodology with me (thanks guys!)&#8230;I&#8217;m downloading now and will be parsing shortly <img src='http://blogs.securiteam.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Last update:  After getting everything converted over to text, I ran a series of checks for different things like checking/saving accounts, ssn, credit card, pr0n, etc.  The only hits were a password to a non-existent site and some pr0n hits in the received box.  All in all, very tame stuff.<br />
